**Last updated:** 2026-05-28
**Total implemented:** 487
**Status:** All in-scope functions implemented

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Implemented | Works with Excel-matching semantics; covered by tests |

Coverage = (Implemented + Partial) / In-scope Total. Excluded functions are not counted in the in-scope total.

The former [remaining formula parity plan](superpowers/plans/2026-05-18-remaining-formula-parity.md) is now historical: its in-scope implementation phases are complete. Current formula work is parity proof and hardening rather than broad function addition:

- Excel-authored cached-result fixture workbooks now cover high-risk financial, statistical, date/time, dynamic-array, lookup/reference, engineering, `LET`, and text-join cases; continue adding targeted edge-case workbooks as parity bugs are found.
- Fuzz/property tests cover inverse and round-trip families such as distribution/inverse pairs, price/yield pairs, XIRR/XNPV, and engineering base conversions.
- Evaluator edge-case audits cover Excel coercion, error precedence, blank/empty handling, range flattening vs. structured range arguments including modern `CONCAT` range flattening, array expressions, spills, volatility, and date serial behavior.
- Structured-reference formula tests cover current-row, `#This Row`, multi-column, spaced-column, and case-insensitive header resolution through formula evaluation.

## Parity Test Sweep

The 2026-05-19 function parity sweep added a catalog guard and category-focused Excel parity suites:

| Area | Coverage added |
|---|---|
| Catalog integrity | Verifies every documented in-scope function is registered, every registered function is documented, and excluded functions remain outside the runtime. |
| Math / Trig | Exhaustive direct coverage for all 50 documented functions, including numeric coercion, domain errors, ranges, matrix outputs, random bounds, subtotals, and conditional aggregates. |
| Statistical | Direct coverage for previously unpinned aliases and modern names: DEVSQ, GAMMALN.PRECISE, MODE.SNGL, PERCENTILE.INC, PERCENTRANK.INC, QUARTILE.INC, RANK.AVG, and RANK.EQ. |
| Logical | Direct coverage for all logical functions, including IF short-circuiting and Excel-style error handling for IFERROR, IFNA, AND, and OR. |
| Information | Direct coverage for CELL, ERROR.TYPE, INFO, IS* predicates, N, NA, and TYPE. |
| Database | Direct coverage for DSTDEV, DSTDEVP, DVAR, and DVARP sample/population semantics, OR/AND criteria behavior, nonnumeric value handling, and empty-match errors. |
| Financial odd-coupon | ODDFPRICE, ODDFYIELD, ODDLPRICE, and ODDLYIELD now match Microsoft Excel documented examples and enforce Excel date-order/frequency/domain errors. |

Verification: `Freexcel.Core.Formula.Tests` passes 2,514/2,514 tests. Formula scalar array coercion parity was hardened across six batches (statistical, financial, range-argument, ChiSq, percentrank, higher-order, and rank functions) since the 2026-05-19 sweep, with broader inverse/round-trip tests for distribution and engineering conversion families, direct volatile registry guards, formula serializer/rewriter guards for modern error literals plus omitted dynamic-array arguments, omitted optional lookup-argument parity guards, database blank-criteria-row parity coverage, engineering base-conversion optional-argument error precedence, engineering fractional conversion/places/shift truncation, financial basis-domain guards, `UNICODE` scalar text coercion, `LEN`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`FIND`/`SEARCH`/`MID`/`REPLACE` surrogate-pair text positions, `LENB`/`LEFTB`/`RIGHTB`/`FINDB`/`SEARCHB`/`MIDB`/`REPLACEB` DBCS byte-count parity, `LEN`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT` range spilling, empty-search scalar end-boundary guards, wildcard matching over surrogate-pair text elements, date serial bounds, modern lookup-array error precedence guards including exact, wildcard, approximate, and duplicate binary-search `XLOOKUP`/`XMATCH` scans, legacy lookup index-domain errors, `#GETTING_DATA` error literal parsing, dynamic-array cell-level error precedence and empty-array `#CALC!` guards, `FILTER` explicit blank `if_empty` plus blank include-cell handling, finite integer-domain guards for `TAKE`/`DROP` slice counts, `WRAPROWS`/`WRAPCOLS` wrap counts, `SEQUENCE` dimensions plus leading blank-argument defaults, and `CHOOSECOLS`/`CHOOSEROWS` indexes, `EXPAND` spill-size caps, spilled-index-array handling for `CHOOSECOLS`/`CHOOSEROWS`, `TOROW`/`TOCOL` scalar-error ignore handling, volatile `RANDARRAY` bounds, structured-reference current-row and spaced-header coverage, East Asian/Thai text function coverage, `BAHTTEXT` satang half-boundary rounding plus satang-only wording, `TEXTJOIN` delimiter-range cycling, `TEXTSPLIT` explicitly omitted `pad_with` defaulting to `#N/A`, `EXACT`/`CODE`/`CHAR` range spilling, local `ENCODEURL`/secure `FILTERXML` coverage, higher-order `REDUCE`/`SCAN` nested-array rejection, `SORTBY` omitted-order handling, `XLOOKUP` omitted-mode defaults plus horizontal return-array coverage, omitted dynamic-array padding defaults, `ADDRESS` sheet-name escaping, `WEEKDAY` omitted return-type defaults, `LEFT`/`RIGHT` omitted length defaults, `LOG` omitted-base defaults, `FIND`/`SEARCH` omitted start defaults, `SUBSTITUTE` omitted instance defaults, `HYPERLINK` omitted friendly-name defaults, `DOLLAR` negative accounting formatting plus explicit blank-decimal behavior, `UNICHAR` fractional-code truncation, `NUMBERVALUE` explicit blank-separator errors, `ROUND`/`MROUND` decimal midpoint parity, and cached Excel-result fixtures for lookup/dynamic-array/LET/text cases including cached `#CALC!` formula errors.

Post-sweep hardening also pins `ASC`, `DBCS`, and `JIS` to Excel's non-DBCS language behavior: width conversion is only applied for DBCS cultures, while English/non-DBCS settings return the original text unchanged. `REGEXREPLACE` now honors Excel's negative `occurrence` semantics by replacing the matching instance counted from the end, including range-spilled text inputs.
