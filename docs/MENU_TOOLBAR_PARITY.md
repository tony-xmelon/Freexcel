<!-- command-inventory:coverage-summary:end -->

Coverage = (Implemented + Partial) / (Implemented + Partial + Not Implemented). Deferred and Excluded items are reported separately.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Implemented | Works like Excel |
| Partial | Works but incomplete; see Notes |
| Not Implemented | Absent; not yet built |
| Deferred | Explicitly postponed because it needs a larger subsystem or interaction architecture |
| Excluded | Out of scope (cloud/proprietary/large subsystem) |

Closeout alignment note: the May 2026 command parity closeout now reflects completed Home-tab cleanup for persistent
Format Painter, alignment and shrink-to-fit style state, AutoFit measurement, and Format Cells dialog coverage. Remaining
Partial rows continue to track intentionally bounded fidelity gaps such as custom/locale number formats, conditional
formatting manager/rendering breadth, table style-theme depth, Flash Fill inference, vector PDF graphics, and remaining
Excel PDF publish options. Advanced
chart-family authoring/rendering remains Deferred until each family has a data model and renderer.
Ribbon overflow now keeps collapsed group menus closer to Excel by preserving cloned menu checked state,
input gesture text, and dynamic menu-open behavior instead of reducing collapsed groups to static labels.
