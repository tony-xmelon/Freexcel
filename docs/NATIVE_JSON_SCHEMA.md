# Freexcel Native JSON Schema

Freexcel `.fxl` files are UTF-8 JSON documents written by `NativeJsonAdapter`. The format is intended to be human-readable, stable enough for project fixtures, and explicit about reader compatibility. The current schema version is `1`.

## Compatibility Header

Every newly saved native JSON workbook writes these root properties:

| Property | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `FileFormat` | string | Must be `Freexcel.NativeJsonWorkbook` for versioned files. Legacy unversioned files may omit it. |
| `SchemaVersion` | number | Writer schema version. Current value: `1`. |
| `MinimumReaderVersion` | number | Oldest reader schema version that may safely load the file. Current value: `1`. |

Legacy unversioned files are accepted as pre-v1 documents and are migrated by save into the current header. Files with unsupported future versions are rejected until an explicit migration path is implemented.

## Workbook Root

The root object stores workbook-wide state:

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | Workbook display name. |
| `Theme` | object | Workbook theme colors and fonts. |
| `IsStructureProtected` | bool | Workbook structure protection state. |
| `StructureProtectionPassword` | string/null | Stored only when structure protection is enabled. |
| `WindowArrangement` | enum/null | Stored workbook window arrangement. Invalid values are ignored. |
| `CalculationMode` | enum/null | Workbook calculation mode. |
| `FullCalculationOnLoad` | bool | Workbook recalculation hint. |
| `DisabledFormulaErrorCodes` | string[] | Supported error-checking codes only. |
| `NamedRanges` | object[] | Workbook named ranges. |
| `WatchedCells` | object[] | Watch Window entries. |
| `Scenarios` | object[] | Scenario Manager definitions. |
| `CustomViews` | object[] | Workbook custom views. |
| `Sheets` | object[] | Worksheet payloads. |

## Workbook Theme

`Theme` stores the workbook theme name, font family choices, and color slots. Colors are serialized as `#RRGGBB`; theme-color references use a color slot plus optional tint.

## Sheets

Each sheet object stores worksheet state:

| Property Group | Notes |
|---|---|
| Identity | `Name`, visibility, tab color. |
| Protection | Sheet protection state, password, and allow-edit ranges. |
| Layout | Row heights, column widths, hidden rows/columns, outline levels, split/freeze pane state, zoom, worksheet view mode, gridline/headings/ruler/formula visibility. |
| Page setup | Print area, paper size, orientation, margins, headers/footers, print titles, page breaks, scale-to-fit, print quality and print options. |
| Content | Cells, style-only cells, merged regions, comments, hyperlinks, data validations, conditional formats, pictures, text boxes, drawing shapes, background image, sparklines, and charts. |
| Metadata | Custom properties, calculation properties, and phonetic properties. |

Loaders validate row and column bounds, skip malformed ranges, clamp invalid numeric layout values, and ignore unsupported enum values where possible.

## Cells

`Cells` entries contain:

| Property | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Address` | string | A1 address on the containing sheet. |
| `Value` | string/null | Serialized scalar value. |
| `ValueType` | string/null | Type tag used by `NativeJsonScalarValueMapper`. |
| `Formula` | string/null | Formula text without the leading `=` convention enforced by the model. |
| `Style` | object/null | Cell style DTO. |
| `IgnoredFormulaErrorCodes` | string[] | Per-cell ignored formula warning codes. |

## Style-Only Cells

`StyleOnlyCells` preserve formatting for blank cells. Each entry has an `Address` and a `Style` object. Invalid addresses are skipped during load.

## Data Validations

`DataValidations` entries store `Range`, validation type, operator, formula/value fields, prompt/error UI flags, and dropdown visibility. Unsupported enum values or malformed ranges are skipped.

## Conditional Formats

`ConditionalFormats` entries store `AppliesTo`, priority, rule type, operator, threshold values, true-format style, and color-scale fields. Unsupported or malformed rules are skipped.

## Charts

`Charts` entries store object placement, chart type, data range, title, legend/axis/data-label settings, gridline state, trendlines, secondary-axis state, combo-line overlay state, per-series formats, per-point label formats, and optional pivot chart metadata. Load sanitization drops unsupported combinations and clamps invalid dimensions or label angles.

## Pictures, Text Boxes, And Drawing Shapes

Visual objects are split into `Pictures`, `TextBoxes`, and `DrawingShapes`. Shared fields include placement, size, rotation, fill/line style, alt text, and name. Pictures may reference embedded image bytes, MIME type, crop percentages, and source-cell anchoring. Invalid object dimensions and rotations are normalized on load.

## Sparklines

`Sparklines` entries store target cell, source data range, sparkline kind, group id, color/style information, marker flags, axis options, and date-axis range. Invalid target cells, ranges, and kinds are skipped.

## Page Layout And Printing

Page layout fields include print area, title rows/columns, page margins, header/footer text, first/even page variants, page order, first page number, black-and-white/draft flags, print quality, comments/error output options, center-on-page flags, row/column page breaks, and scale-to-fit settings. Invalid numeric values fall back to safe defaults.

## Protection

Workbook structure protection and sheet protection are stored separately. Sheet-level `AllowEditRanges` are A1 ranges on the containing sheet. Invalid or cross-sheet allow-edit ranges are skipped.

## Named Ranges

`NamedRanges` entries include `Name`, `RefersTo`, and optional `Comment`/scope metadata. Malformed ranges are ignored so one bad name does not block the workbook.

## Watched Cells

`WatchedCells` entries store sheet name/id context and cell address. Invalid or missing sheet/cell references are ignored.

## Scenarios

`Scenarios` entries store scenario name, comment, hidden/locked flags, and changing-cell values. Scenario cell values use the same scalar value serialization and type tags as worksheet cells.

## Custom Views

`CustomViews` entries store view name, GUID, active sheet, print settings, row/column visibility, pane state, and per-sheet view overrides. Invalid pane state is sanitized on load.

## Migration Policy

Every schema version bump must add migration tests in `NativeJsonSchemaTests` covering:

1. Loading the previous schema version and saving it as the new current version.
2. Rejecting unsupported future versions.
3. Preserving legacy unversioned file loading unless an explicit breaking-change decision removes it.
4. Documenting the changed DTO fields in this schema reference.

Reader compatibility should advance `MinimumReaderVersion` only when older readers would misinterpret data rather than safely ignoring it.
