# Freexcel XLSX Fidelity Contract

**Status:** v1 working contract  
**Last updated:** 2026-05-22

Freexcel saves supported `.xlsx` workbook content from the in-memory model. For workbooks opened from native `.xlsx`, it also keeps a source package snapshot and merges package entries the model writer did not produce, along with content type declarations and relationships to copied targets. This is package-preserving best effort, not byte-for-byte editing of every OOXML node.

## Best-Effort Or Partial

- Conditional formatting beyond modeled rules may be skipped.
- Supported custom views are model-backed through `Workbook.CustomViews` when Excel workbook custom-view GUIDs match worksheet custom-sheet-view entries. Freexcel persists view mode, pane state, gridline/headings/ruler/formula flags, and zoom; print settings, hidden row/column snapshots, filters, selections, window geometry, and personal/shared-view metadata remain partial or native-retained.
- Supported What-If Analysis worksheet scenarios are model-backed for load/save only when every changing cell is a same-sheet A1 `inputCells/@r` reference with a literal scalar `@val`. Load does not execute or apply scenarios. A workbook scenario with changes on multiple sheets is saved as one worksheet scenario entry per sheet with the shared scenario name. Supported scenario names are model-authoritative on save, so removing a loaded scenario from `Workbook.Scenarios` removes its supported source entries; unsupported or malformed native scenario entries remain best-effort retained.
- Unknown worksheet extension-list entries are retained by extension URI; Freexcel does not interpret those extension payloads.
- Unknown workbook extension-list entries are retained by extension URI; Freexcel does not interpret those extension payloads.
- Native workbook file-version metadata is retained but not interpreted.
- Native workbook file-sharing metadata is retained but not interpreted.
- Native workbook file-recovery metadata is retained but not interpreted.
- Native workbook smart-tag metadata is retained, but Freexcel does not expose smart-tag editing.
- Native workbook function-group metadata is retained, but Freexcel does not expose custom function group editing.
- Additional workbook views are retained, but Freexcel does not yet expose workbook-window view editing.
- Native custom workbook views are retained, but Freexcel does not expose custom-view editing.
- Unsupported workbook `workbookPr` details are retained, but Freexcel does not expose every native workbook-property switch.
- Unsupported worksheet `sheetPr` details are retained, but Freexcel does not expose every native sheet-property switch.
- Supported ignored-error refs are model-backed through `Cell.IgnoreFormulaError`; detailed native flags and unsupported refs remain best-effort retained.
- Supported cell-watch refs are model-backed through `Workbook.WatchedCells` and the Watch Window UI; native-only watch attributes and unsupported entries remain best-effort retained.
- Worksheet `sheetCalcPr/@fullCalcOnLoad` is model-backed through `Sheet.FullCalculationOnLoad`; native-only calculation attributes remain best-effort retained, and Freexcel does not expose per-sheet calculation settings.
- Worksheet `phoneticPr` fontId/type/alignment attributes are model-backed through `Sheet.PhoneticProperties`; native-only phonetic metadata remains best-effort retained, but Freexcel does not expose phonetic display editing or rendering.
- Native worksheet sort-state metadata is retained, but Freexcel does not expose the full sort-state editing surface.
- Native worksheet data-consolidation metadata is retained, but Freexcel does not expose Data Consolidate execution or editing.
- Unsupported native `sheetProtection` details are retained, but Freexcel does not expose every native protection option or strong-hash setting.
- Unsupported native `workbookProtection` details are retained, but Freexcel does not expose every native workbook protection option or strong-hash setting.
- Supported protected ranges are model-backed through `Sheet.AllowEditRanges`; native-only advanced allow-edit-range security options remain partial.
- Native custom XML package parts are retained, but Freexcel does not expose XML mapping or custom XML editing.
- Native header/footer legacy drawing references and linked VML/media parts are retained, but Freexcel does not expose header/footer image editing.
- Native worksheet custom-property metadata is retained, but Freexcel does not expose worksheet custom-property editing.
- Native worksheet smart-tag metadata is retained, but Freexcel does not expose smart-tag editing.
- Native sheet-level AutoFilter metadata is retained, but Freexcel does not expose the full worksheet filter execution/editing surface.
- Additional worksheet views are retained, but Freexcel does not expose multi-view editing.
- Worksheet `printOptions` and `pageSetup` source-package merges are model-authoritative for fields represented on `Sheet`; native-only attributes are copied only when they do not conflict with modeled state.
- Data validation formulas are preserved only for supported rule shapes.
- PivotTable metadata load/save, native package retention, authored pivot package parts, same-sheet/cross-sheet creation, refresh, undoable command-level field layout/source editing, values-only and column-only layouts, multiple row fields, multiple column fields with nested matrix headers, Compact/Outline/Tabular report-layout state with Compact row-label rendering, multiple data fields, common/statistical summary functions, built-in and custom workbook-catalog value-field number formats with Value Field Settings custom-code authoring, single/multi-select page/row/column checked-item filtering, date/number grouping, row/column label filters including comparison/between variants, row/column value filters with field-target round-trip including between/not-between and above/below-average variants, Excel-style Show Values As modes including percent totals, running total, difference/% difference, rank, index, and parent-total variants with base field/item settings, value/label sorting including column label/value sorting, separate row/column grand-total visibility, repeated-label suppression, blank-line spacing, undoable PivotTable Options editing for modeled "For empty cells show" text on missing matrix intersections, style-name/style-option/custom PivotStyle definition round-trip with rendered header/subtotal/grand-total/banded formatting, top/bottom subtotals, calculated fields/items, ribbon/double-click Show Details drill-down detail-sheet creation for item/subtotal/grand-total/matrix/column-only data cells, PivotChart output-range sync, Field List drag/drop, PivotChart field-button menus, slicer/timeline filtering UI, authored slicer/timeline state/cache relationships, and pivot-cache refresh/shared-item/external-OLAP source metadata are implemented. Exact full-gallery PivotStyle UI/rendering semantics and external/OLAP/data-model refresh or execution remain partial.
- PivotCharts are modeled as bound charts and round-trip native `pivotSource`, `pivotFmts`, chart external-data relationship pointers and package relationship type/target/target-mode metadata, plot-area and legend manual layout metadata, date-system/language, color-map overrides, print-settings, style id, chart protection flags, rounded-corner, auto-title-deleted, hidden-row-data visibility, blank-display, and data-label-over-maximum metadata. Field buttons are rendered with master and per-button report-filter/axis-field/value-field visibility, the PivotChart Options command/dialog exposes the same visibility flags with undo, route to PivotTable sort/filter/value-settings menus, and bound chart type changes preserve the PivotTable connection; Excel's full PivotChart layout/editing surface remains partial.
- Freexcel has a native workbook theme model scaffold, maps `.xlsx` theme parts to/from it, resolves loaded cell-style theme colors/tints against it, renders persisted drawing-object plus chart theme color references, renders Subtle/Refined drawing-object shadow effects, and has undoable Page Layout Themes/Colors/Fonts/Effects preset menus plus a custom theme dialog for name, heading/body fonts, effects, and core color slots. `Core.IO` can parse DrawingML `schemeClr`/`srgbClr` colors and load/save simple embedded package parts for every current native chart type through worksheet/drawing relationships with `twoCellAnchor` bounds/EMU offsets, `oneCellAnchor` bounds, `absoluteAnchor` bounds, no-header and no-category-column series range semantics, chart title/range with title text color/font size, axis titles with text color/font size, value-axis bounds/units/log-scale/number formats, axis gridline visibility/color/thickness, tick marks, axis label visibility, axis line color/thickness, legend visibility/position/text/fill/border/theme-text/font-size, global data-label visibility/position/content/number-format/fill/border/text/font/rotation/callout baseline, per-point data-label fill/border/text/font formatting, trendline type/equation/R-squared/line formatting, common column/area combo line-overlay and column/area/line/scatter secondary-value-axis package state, chart/plot area fill and plot border, bar direction/grouping, scatter/bubble X/Y ranges and value-axis pairs, bubble-size ranges, pie/doughnut first-slice angle and exploded-slice package state, doughnut hole size, line/scatter series color-width-dash-marker and marker-fill package formatting, and filled-series fill/outline color-width-dash package formatting, but richer XLSX chart-package formatting and deeper OOXML effect semantics remain deferred, so chart theme/indexed colors from unsupported `.xlsx` chart parts may still be incomplete until those adapters consume the theme model end to end.
- Formula compatibility depends on the current parser/function library. Unsupported Excel syntax may load as text/formula text but fail Freexcel calculation.

## Retained As Unsupported Package Parts

These feature assets are retained best-effort when the workbook was opened from `.xlsx`, even though Freexcel does not execute or deeply edit them:

- VBA macros and VBA projects
- Unmodeled slicer/timeline OOXML package details beyond Freexcel's modeled metadata, authored selection state, connected filtering, and retained floating drawing anchors
- Unsupported charts and chart formatting
- Deeper OOXML effect semantics and full XLSX chart-theme extraction beyond the current native/XLSX workbook theme model, loaded-cell-style color-resolution, drawing-object theme-rendering/effect baseline, simple embedded native-chart package loading, chart theme-color rendering, preset menus, and custom theme dialog baseline
- External workbook links and linked data model artifacts
- Embedded/OLE objects
- Custom OOXML package parts not represented in `Core.Model`
- Unsupported workbook, worksheet, view, protection, and metadata settings

Microsoft 365 Share/co-authoring state, cloud permissions, presence, version history, and other cloud/service state are outside local XLSX package fidelity.

## Explicit Product Exclusions

The following Excel features are not Freexcel parity targets unless a future design document explicitly brings them into scope:

- Microsoft 365 Share/co-authoring, OneDrive/SharePoint permissions, Teams-linked sharing, and live collaborator presence.
- VBA compatibility, macro execution, COM add-ins, and Office Scripts.
- Power Query, Power Pivot, OLAP/data model features, and Microsoft linked data types.
- Enterprise Microsoft 365 controls such as sensitivity labels and IRM.

See [COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md](COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md) for the command-level parity matrix.
See [XLSX_TEST_CORPUS_PLAN.md](XLSX_TEST_CORPUS_PLAN.md) for the Sprint 2 corpus collection and reporting plan.
See [XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md](XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md) for the current executable corpus status.

## Required Before Claiming Higher Fidelity

- Add more committed issue-specific regression workbooks and local-private user torture samples.
- Complete manual desktop Excel open/save/reopen review for representative native samples.
- Extend unsupported-feature detection and user warnings as new unsupported OOXML classes are discovered.
- Keep this contract aligned with executable tests in `tests/Freexcel.Core.IO.Tests`.
