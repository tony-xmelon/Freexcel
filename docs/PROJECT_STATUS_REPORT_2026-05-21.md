# Freexcel Project Status Report

Generated: 2026-05-21
Branch: `main`

## Executive Summary

Freexcel is in late-stage UI polish and tooling hardening. The command surface is at **100% coverage** (156 implemented + 25 partial, 0 not-implemented), formula engine is at 345/345 in-scope functions, XLSX corpus is at 90/90 manifest rows passing, and test count has grown from ~3,380 to **~4,913 passing** (with 14 in-progress failures in the App.Host suite from active ribbon icon work).

The most significant in-flight work is a **ribbon icon overhaul** (uncommitted, in working directory): larger command buttons, PNG image icon loading infrastructure, and a full toolbar icon design document (`docs/TOOLBAR_ICON_DESIGN_INVENTORY.md`).

Overall completion estimate: **87%**

## Work Completed Since 2026-05-13

### Dialog parity wave 2
- **Tabbed data validation dialog** — tabbed layout matching Excel structure
- **Paste Special operation radios** — arithmetic/transpose radio options in Paste Special
- **AutoFilter color picker** — color picker entry point in AutoFilter dialog
- **Shape gradient color pickers** — two-color gradient fills and shadow for drawn shapes
- **Chart dialog color pickers** — color picker buttons in chart format dialogs
- **Pivot source reference picker** — live range picker for Change Data Source
- **Selection Pane bulk visibility** — show-all / hide-all buttons in Selection Pane
- **Dialog access keys** — Evaluate Formula, Export Options, Pivot Filter, Header/Footer, Named Range, Custom Views dialogs all get access keys

### Formula scalar array parity fixes
Six batches of fixes for functions that didn't correctly coerce scalar arguments from array contexts: statistical, financial, range-argument, ChiSq, percentrank, higher-order, and rank functions.

### XLSX metadata retention
- Preserve rich shared string run metadata (bold/italic/color runs inside cells)
- Preserve legacy comment rich text metadata
- Preserve worksheet hyperlink metadata
- Preserve worksheet `sheetData` extension lists
- Preserve worksheet page margin metadata

### Custom number format improvements
- Preserve literal percent custom formats
- Percent token placement parity

### Pivot table improvements
- Expanded pivot reference picker dialog surface
- Cross-sheet source data picker for Change Source workflow

### Keyboard shortcuts
Access keys added to: Evaluate Formula, Export Options, Pivot Filter (label/value), Header/Footer, Named Range, Custom Views dialogs.

### XLSX corpus / IO
- `XlsxFileAdapter`: +188 lines of new retention/round-trip handling
- `FileAdapterSmokeTests`: +232 lines of new smoke tests

### Test growth
New test files: `AutoFilterDialogTests`, `ChartDialogTests` (+39), `DataValidationDialogTests` (+11), `ExportPlannerTests` (+22), `FormulaDialogAccessKeyTests` (+14), `ObjectDialogTests` (+12), `PasteSpecialDialogTests` (+24), `PivotFilterDialogXamlTests` (+38), `PivotWorkflowDialogTests` (+10), `SelectionPanePlannerTests` (+12), `ChiSqScalarArrayTests` (+27), `FinancialScalarArrayTests` (+32), `PercentRankScalarArrayTests` (+30), `RangeArgumentScalarArrayTests` (+41), `StatisticalScalarArrayTests` (+34), `FileAdapterSmokeTests` (+232).

## In-Progress Work (Uncommitted, Working Directory)

**Ribbon icon overhaul** — significant uncommitted changes across 5 files:

| File | Change summary |
| --- | --- |
| `MainWindow.Ribbon.cs` | +360 lines: button height increases (Large: 64→92px, Medium: 50→58px, Small: 22→30px), font size 10→13, `CreateCommandIcon` PNG loader integration, `CloneRibbonMenuContent` helper, label text sizing helpers |
| `RibbonIconFactory.cs` | +142 lines: `CreateCommandIcon` method, PNG caching infrastructure, DPI-aware size helper, multi-tier pixel size constants (24–96px), `IsWhiteBrush` guard |
| `RibbonCommandPresentationPlanner.cs` | +4 lines: Paste, Conditional Formatting, Format as Table, Cell Styles promoted to Large layout kind |
| `MainWindow.xaml` | +16 lines: related layout changes |
| `Freexcel.App.Host.csproj` | +1 line: new dependency |

This work was also preceded by `docs/TOOLBAR_ICON_DESIGN_INVENTORY.md` — a complete design approval document listing every command surface icon, with 40px/24px PNG previews for ~120 commands, generated from SVG source in `assets/command-icons/`. The inventory is a design artifact; PNG assets have been generated and committed.

**The 14 failing tests** are all caused by this in-progress ribbon work:
- `DenseRibbonCommandColumns_UseShortRowButtons` — buttons now 38px tall; test expects ≤24px
- 9 `MainWindowSourceHygieneTests` — source text assertions check for patterns the modified ribbon files no longer match
- 3 `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests` — keytip handling tests broken by ribbon changes
- 1 `TableStyleGalleryPlannerTests.MainWindow_PopulatesFormatAsTableMenuFromGalleryPlanner` — gallery planner test broken by ribbon changes

## Outstanding Work

### High priority
1. **Complete ribbon icon implementation** — finish and commit the working-directory PNG icon loading work; fix the 14 failing tests (update source hygiene expectations and the adaptive ribbon height test)
2. **XLSX corpus expansion** — grow from 90 to 100+ manifest rows; graduate smoke tests to per-feature structural comparisons; target 95% fidelity proof before public release claim
3. **Release packaging** — MSIX release automation, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, release notes workflow

### Medium priority
4. **Keyboard parity** — UI automation coverage for shortcut matrix; keytip overlay placement improvements; nested submenu keytips for new menus
5. **CF/formatting polish** — full icon-set authoring/editing; richer color-scale/data-bar options; complete rule manager dialog
6. **Chart and object polish** — advanced chart families (surface, histogram, treemap, waterfall, etc.); interactive drag/resize handles; richer effects and shape formatting
7. **Data workflow polish** — Data Validation range-picker UX; Forecast chart UI; Scenario PivotTable reports

### Low priority / deferred
8. **Multi-threaded recalculation** — profile first; implement only if large-workbook profiling proves it necessary
9. **Large XLSX parse optimization** — SAX streaming for shared strings; lazy/incremental sheet load
10. **View/window management** — true multi-window hosting (New Window, Side-by-Side, etc.)

## Loose Ends

- `main` has not been pushed to `origin/main`
- Stash `codex-preserve-mainwindow-before-main-sync-2` may need to be reviewed or dropped
- Several `.tmp-build-*` worktree directories remain in the working root
