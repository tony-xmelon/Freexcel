# Freexcel Project Status Report

Generated: 2026-05-19 (refreshed 2026-05-20)
Baseline branch: `codex/bugfixing` at `c0cd671f` (`fix: preserve chart metadata during sync`)
Repository position: `codex/bugfixing` is ahead of `origin/main` by 59 commits as of this refresh.

## Executive Summary

Freexcel is in late parity-expansion mode with the paused workstreams consolidated back into `main`. The mainline now includes responsive ribbon QA, command/autofit parity, XLSX metadata retention, host planner extractions, formula time serial parity, worksheet context menu planning, custom/accounting number-format improvements, app icon/design work, and export/PDF fallback planning.

Overall completion estimate: **84%**

This checkout currently uses `codex/bugfixing` and keeps a large set of auxiliary worktrees for parity and UI-follow-up work.

## Workstream Status

| Workstream | Status | Completion | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Mainline consolidation | Integrated and verified | 98% | Final workspace is on `main`; extra worktrees and merged branch labels are pruned. |
| Responsive ribbon, format painter, and design/icon work | Merged and cleaned | 97% | Design artifacts were removed after confirmation that the design work is merged. |
| Command parity, autofit, number formats, export planning | Merged and verified | 97% | Includes autofit sizing, Format Cells mappings, number format hardening, and export/PDF fallback planner tests. |
| XLSX metadata retention | Merged | 90% | Advanced protection metadata, custom XML, header/footer legacy drawings, and worksheet custom properties are retained. |
| Host planner refactor | Merged | 88% | Text editor, navigation, slicer/timeline, sparkline, pivot UI, and chart planner extractions merged. |
| Formula date/time serial parity | Merged | 90% | Time serial parity and duplicate-helper cleanup are on `main`. |
| Keyboard and formula audit branches | Merged / pruned | 92% | Branches were patch-equivalent or merged and have been deleted locally. |
| Agent XLSX/pivot phase | Retired locally | 20% | Conflicted worktree removed; branch had no remaining unique patch delta against `main`. |

## Completion by Area

| Area | Estimated Completion | Current Read |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Workbook/model fundamentals | 91% | Stable model, command, and IO integration with broad regression coverage. |
| Formula engine | 87% | Strong parity coverage, especially date/time serials; long-tail Excel edge cases remain. |
| Command parity | 88% | Autofit, formatting, context menu, export, keyboard, and selection paths are substantially merged. |
| XLSX fidelity | 82% | Metadata retention continues to improve; full byte-level OOXML editing remains out of scope. |
| WPF host / ribbon UX | 82% | Responsive ribbon, icon/design updates, export planning, and planner extractions are merged. |
| Keyboard parity | 82% | Cross-sheet audit and shortcut work are merged or patch-equivalent. |
| Documentation / project tracking | 80% | Status docs and parity reports are current as of this cleanup pass. |
| Release readiness | 76% | Mainline is green and locally clean; remote push/release packaging remains. |

## Loose Ends

1. `main` has not been pushed to `origin/main`.
2. Release packaging/signoff remains separate from this merge cleanup.

## Verification

Final verification on `main`:
