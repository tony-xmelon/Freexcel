# Freexcel Project Status Report

Generated: 2026-05-25  
Branch observed: `codex/docs-cleanup-20260525`  
Mainline observed: `origin/main` at `cf9d4491e`

## Executive Summary

Freexcel remains in late-stage parity hardening. The broad feature baseline is strong: formula coverage is documented at **345/345 in-scope functions**, command surface coverage remains at **100% of in-scope commands**, and XLSX/corpus work has moved from first-pass coverage into fidelity proof, package retention, and edge-case hardening.

The main operational risk is again coordination rather than a single missing feature. The workspace currently has many active worktrees and local branches, including several dirty implementation branches. Treat `main`/`origin/main` plus this report, [OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md](OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md), [NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md](NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md), [COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md](COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md), [SHORTCUT_PARITY_MATRIX.md](SHORTCUT_PARITY_MATRIX.md), [FIDELITY_CONTRACT.md](FIDELITY_CONTRACT.md), and [XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md](XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md) as the current documentation set.

Overall completion estimate remains **91%**: most in-scope surfaces exist, while remaining work is advanced fidelity, polish, verification, packaging, and release readiness.

## Current Repository State

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Current docs branch | `codex/docs-cleanup-20260525` |
| Mainline | `origin/main` at `cf9d4491e` |
| Registered worktrees | 25 |
| Local branches | 161 |
| Local branches not merged to `main` | 89 |
| Dirty worktrees observed | 9 |
| Stashes | none observed |

The root checkout at `E:/Users/anton/Documents/Claude/Freexcel` is currently on `codex/advanced-chart-families` with local untracked `.claude/` state. Documentation cleanup is isolated in `.worktrees/docs-cleanup-20260525`.

## Active Workstreams

The following workstreams appear active or recently active from local branch/worktree state:

| Workstream | Branch examples | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dialog parity and dialog cleanup | `codex/dialog-parity-loop`, `codex/dialog-parity-loop-clean` | Active; one dirty branch has a large local change set. |
| Advanced charts and chart fidelity | `codex/advanced-chart-families` | Active root checkout; merged to local `main` but root branch is behind current `origin/main`. |
| Formula regression hardening | `codex/formula-regression-hardening` and many formula integration branches | Active; several focused range/spill hardening branches exist. |
| Pivot grouping and validation | `codex/pivot-grouping-validation` | Active and dirty. |
| Ribbon/icon/layout polish | `codex/icon-consistency-pass`, `codex/ribbon-icon-review-pass`, `codex/ribbon-layout-loop-continued` | Active; icon consistency and layout branches include dirty local state. |
| Refactor / refresh / test diagnostics | `codex/refactor-refresh*`, `codex/test-distribution-diagnostics`, `codex/tester-*` | Mixed merged and active verification branches. |
| Release automation | `codex/release-automation`, `codex/tester-release-ci-fix` | Present; release documentation and packaging remain backlog items. |

Recommended operating rule: before opening another broad workstream, merge or explicitly pause dirty branches that touch the same file families, especially dialog shell, ribbon shell, chart/XLSX readers, pivot models, and formula evaluators.

## Source Metrics

Measured on 2026-05-25 from the docs-cleanup worktree:

| Area | Files | Lines |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Source C# (`src/**/*.cs`) | 742 | 122,980 |
| Test C# (`tests/**/*.cs`) | 336 | 95,214 |
| XAML (`src/**/*.xaml`) | 20 | 6,976 |
| Markdown docs (`docs/**/*.md`) | 220 | 19,115 |

These are simple line counts, not semantic code metrics.

## Current Parity Snapshot

| Surface | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Formula engine | 345/345 in-scope functions documented as implemented; current work is edge-case parity proof. |
| Command surface | 100% of in-scope commands covered; partial items are depth/polish gaps. |
| Keyboard shortcuts | 83% parity, 17% partial, 0 missing in the current matrix. |
| XLSX fidelity | 71 in-scope feature categories with support; package-preserving save, corpus expansion, and deeper comparisons remain active. |
| UI/dialog parity | Broad coverage; active branches continue polishing focus, access keys, dialog shells, and exact Excel behavior. |
| Release readiness | Packaging and user-facing release docs remain open. |

## Documentation Cleanup Notes

This pass updates the documentation index, records a fresh status snapshot, and removes stale references to the May 23 report as the current status document. Historical `docs/superpowers/plans/*` and `docs/superpowers/specs/*` files remain useful implementation records but should not be treated as current build-status sources.

Known documentation cleanups still worth doing:

1. Split the very large [CODE_REVIEW.md](CODE_REVIEW.md) into current findings plus an archive.
2. Decide whether generated icon preview/design inventory assets should remain in `docs/` or move under a generated-artifact location.
3. Keep the release-facing docs (`USER_GUIDE.md` and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`) plus the release notes workflow aligned with `main`.
4. Keep [OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md](OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md) and [NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md](NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md) aligned whenever active branches merge.
