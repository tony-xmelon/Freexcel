# FreeX Project Status Report

Generated: 2026-05-27
Observed at: 2026-05-27T09:46:09+03:00
Report scope: hourly maintenance refresh from the `tester-release-main-sync` worktree
Mainline observed: local `main` at `c8164b58d`; `origin/main` at `03c870dcf`

## Executive Summary

FreeX remains in late-stage parity hardening. Core product surfaces are broad and functional: formula coverage remains **345/345 in-scope functions**, command coverage remains **100% for in-scope commands**, and XLSX fidelity work is still focused on deeper retention proof, corpus depth, and package-health validation rather than first-pass support.

Overall completion still reads as **91-92%**. The remaining work is verification depth, Excel-edge fidelity, release packaging/signing, accessibility review, and coordination across many parallel branches and worktrees.

The May 27 heartbeat maintenance pass fetched and pruned remote refs, removed 14 clean merged worktrees, deleted 15 merged local branch refs, pruned stale worktree admin metadata, and refreshed the docs index/status set. Dirty worktrees, unmerged branches, detached integration worktrees, and remote-backed active branches were left intact.

## Current Repository State

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Mainline | Local `main` at `c8164b58d`; `origin/main` at `03c870dcf`; local `main` is ahead by 31 commits and behind by 0 |
| Branch posture | Parallel feature branches remain active; many local branches intentionally track `origin/main` with long-running ahead/behind history, so merge status alone is not a deletion signal |
| Worktree posture | 24 registered worktrees remain, including detached integration worktrees and active feature worktrees |
| Git maintenance | `git fetch --all --prune` completed; 14 clean merged worktrees and 15 merged local branch refs were removed; `git worktree prune --verbose` completed after cleanup |
| Cleanup blockers | Dirty worktrees remain on `codex/advanced-chart-families`, `codex/chart-stock-format-dialog`, `codex/conditional-format-catalog`, `codex/performance-improvements`, `codex/scenario-manager-state-extraction`, `codex/screenshot-foreground-safety`, `main`, and `codex/uia-pattern-guard`; unmerged or active remote-backed branches were left untouched |
| Commit/push posture | Docs are ready for validation and commit from local `main`; push is safe only if `origin/main` has not moved again |
| Dirty paths observed | Maintenance docs are modified in the `main` worktree; the separate `codex/advanced-chart-families` worktree also has unrelated user/session-owned code changes and was left untouched |

## Current Parity Snapshot

| Surface | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Formula engine | 345/345 in-scope functions implemented and tested; current work is edge-case parity proof, cached-result fixtures, array coercion, and spill/volatility hardening. |
| Command surface | 100% of in-scope commands covered; remaining items are depth/polish gaps. |
| Keyboard shortcuts | **84% parity** (71/85), **16% partial** (14/85), **0 missing**. |
| XLSX fidelity | 71 in-scope feature categories with support; 144 workbook manifest rows; package-preserving save, corpus expansion, and deeper comparisons remain active. |
| UI/dialog parity | Broad coverage; active work remains in dialog polish, chart family coverage, split/layout fidelity, and deeper keyboard/range-picker parity. |
| Release readiness | `USER_GUIDE.md` and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` are written; tester-release workflow is JSON-versioned and produces unsigned local MSIX packages when Windows SDK tooling is available; signing, installer trust validation, accessibility pass, and release-note polish remain open. |

## Active Workstream Picture

Parallel work is active by design. Current worktrees still cover chart-family work, dialog parity, command parity, XLSX/open-format fidelity, performance, refactor refresh, user-feedback retest, ribbon/layout polish, and other focused implementation slices.

Operational risk remains mostly coordination:

- Keep session branches synced from `main` before editing shared files.
- Merge small verified slices frequently.
- Treat clean merged worktrees as active unless there is stronger evidence they are abandoned.
- Treat local `main` as ahead of `origin/main` until the maintenance docs and pending main commits are pushed.
- Keep docs, `release/progress.json`, and release workflow naming aligned whenever the completion band changes.

## Hourly Maintenance Results

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Remote pruning | `git fetch --all --prune` completed successfully. |
| Worktree pruning | Removed 14 clean merged worktrees and then ran `git worktree prune --verbose`. |
| Safe deletion candidates | Clean merged worktrees without active `origin/codex/*` tracking branches were pruned; dirty, detached, unmerged, and active remote-backed worktrees were retained. |
| Deletion outcome | Deleted 15 merged local branch refs, including `codex/ribbon-layout-transient-fix`. |
| Active branch guardrails | Dirty or attached worktrees, including `codex/advanced-chart-families`, several merged-but-dirty feature worktrees, and the `origin: gone` `codex/performance-improvements` worktree, were left untouched. |
| Docs refresh | `README.md`, `OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md`, and this report were refreshed to match the current snapshot. |
| Push decision | Pending validation and commit; local `main` is ahead of `origin/main` and not behind at this snapshot. |

## Remaining Outstanding Work

See [OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md](OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md) for the source-of-truth backlog. Key open items:

1. **XLSX corpus and fidelity proof** - Expand the 144-row corpus baseline; publish pass/fail rate by feature bucket.
2. **Package-preserving XLSX save path** - Broader retention coverage and manual desktop Excel validation.
3. **Release documentation and packaging** - Signing, installer trust validation, release-note workflow polish, and real accessibility pass with keyboard-only and screen-reader validation.
4. **Shortcut and keytip verification** - Continue UI automation coverage beyond the first process-scoped visible-control snapshot, including pixel-perfect keytip overlay placement and future nested submenu keytips beyond Conditional Formatting.
5. **XLSX warning coverage as new gaps are found** - Keep unsupported-feature detection aligned with newly discovered OOXML package parts.

Product parity remaining is tracked in [NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md](NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md), including Phase 7D: Deeper color-scale XLSX edge semantics as new gaps are found. Current planning and parity sources: [COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md](COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md), [MENU_TOOLBAR_PARITY.md](MENU_TOOLBAR_PARITY.md), [SHORTCUT_PARITY_MATRIX.md](SHORTCUT_PARITY_MATRIX.md), [FIDELITY_CONTRACT.md](FIDELITY_CONTRACT.md), and [XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md](XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md).
