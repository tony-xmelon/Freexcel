| **Grid** | The cell grid. Click to navigate; drag to select. |
| **Sheet Tabs** | Add, rename, reorder, hide, or delete sheets by right-clicking a tab. |
| **Status Bar** | Sum, count, average, min, and max for the current selection. |

### Saving

## Conditional Formatting

### Quick Rules (Home → Conditional Formatting)

- **Highlight Cell Rules** — Greater than, Less than, Between, Equal to, text containing, dates.
- **Top/Bottom Rules** — Top 10 items, bottom 10%, above/below average.

### Managing Rules

Home → Conditional Formatting → Manage Rules opens the rule manager for the selection or entire sheet. Rules apply in listed priority order; check "Stop If True" to prevent lower-priority rules from running.

### Formula-Based Rules

Use a formula that returns TRUE/FALSE to apply to any range. The formula references the top-left cell of the applied range. For example, `=$B2>100` highlights rows where column B exceeds 100.

---

## Data Tools

### Sort

Data tab → Sort (A-Z, Z-A, or custom multi-level sort dialog). Sort by cell value, cell color, font color, or icon. Hold Shift while clicking the header-sort buttons to add secondary sort keys.

### AutoFilter

Data tab → AutoFilter (or Home → Sort & Filter → Filter). Column header dropdowns let you filter by value, color, text/number/date conditions, and search. The Data tab also has Clear Filter.

### Advanced Filter

Data tab → Advanced Filter copies filtered rows to another location or filters in place, using a criteria range you define on the sheet.

### Text to Columns

Data tab → Text to Columns splits cell content on a delimiter or fixed-width positions.

### Remove Duplicates

Data tab → Remove Duplicates with column selection for matching.

### Data Validation

Data tab → Data Validation. Set allowable values (whole number, decimal, list, date, time, text length, custom formula). Add an input message and error alert. Paste Validation transfers rules.

### Consolidate

Data tab → Consolidate aggregates values from multiple ranges, including across sheets.

### What-If Analysis

Data tab → What-If Analysis:
- **Goal Seek** — Find the input value that produces a target result.
- **Scenario Manager** — Name and switch between sets of input cell values. Summary reports can include optional result cells so each scenario column shows the resulting output values.
- **Data Table** — One- or two-variable sensitivity tables.

### Forecast Sheet

Data tab → Forecast Sheet generates a forecast using exponential smoothing, adding a new sheet with projections and a chart.

### Subtotals

Data tab → Subtotal inserts automatic subtotals at group changes. Group and Outline controls collapse/expand groups.

### Flash Fill

Data tab → Flash Fill (or Ctrl+E) infers a pattern from your manual examples and fills the rest of the column.

### Page Setup

Page Layout tab → Page Setup:
- **Page** — Orientation, scaling (% or fit to N×M pages), paper size.
- **Margins** — Top, bottom, left, right, header, footer.
- **Sheet** — Print area, print titles (rows/columns to repeat), gridlines, headings, row/column order.

### Setting a Print Area

Select the range to print, then Page Layout → Print Area → Set Print Area. Page Layout → Print Area → Clear Print Area removes it.

### Export to PDF

File → Export to PDF/XPS. Options:
- **Active sheet, selected range, or entire workbook.**

### Headers and Footers

Insert tab → Header & Footer (or Page Layout → Page Setup → Header/Footer tab) to add page numbers, file name, date, and custom text to printed pages.

---

## File Formats

### XLSX (`.xlsx`)

The primary format. Freexcel reads and writes standard OOXML `.xlsx` files. When opening an Excel-authored file:
- All supported features are loaded into the workbook model.
- Unsupported features (VBA macros, Power Query, ActiveX controls, etc.) are detected and reported as warnings. The package parts for those features are preserved and written back unchanged so you do not lose them when saving.

### CSV (`.csv`)

Freexcel opens and saves CSV files as single-sheet workbooks. Delimiter detection is automatic on open.

### Native Format (`.fxl`)

Freexcel's own JSON-based format. Smaller than XLSX for workbooks without complex Excel-only metadata. Use `.fxl` when working primarily in Freexcel; use `.xlsx` for compatibility with Excel and other applications.

### Opening Files with Warnings

If a workbook contains features Freexcel cannot fully model (VBA, Power Query, embedded objects, etc.), an info bar shows on open. The file opens with all supported content visible; unsupported package parts are retained invisibly and will be written back on save. **No data is silently discarded.**

## Tips and Tricks

- **Named Ranges in Formulas:** Type a range name instead of a cell address. Name Manager (Ctrl+F3) lists all defined names.
- **Absolute vs. Relative References:** Use `$A$1` for absolute, `A1` for relative, `$A1` or `A$1` for mixed. Press **F4** while editing a cell reference to cycle through the options.
- **Array Formulas:** Most functions handle arrays natively. For legacy array behavior, Ctrl+Shift+Enter enters a curly-brace array formula.
- **Custom Number Formats:** In Format Cells → Number → Custom, enter Excel-compatible format codes (e.g., `#,##0.00` for two-decimal thousands, `dd/mm/yyyy` for dates).
- **Freeze Headers:** View → Freeze Top Row keeps row 1 visible while scrolling.
- **Multiple Sheets:** Right-click a sheet tab for color, rename, move, copy, hide/unhide, and insert options. Hold Ctrl while clicking tabs to select multiple sheets and edit them together.
- **Spell Check (F7):** Checks the active sheet's text content.
