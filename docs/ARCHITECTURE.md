# Architecture

Freexcel is a free, native Windows desktop spreadsheet application with a WPF shell, a command-driven workbook engine, and explicit `.xlsx` fidelity boundaries. Current outstanding work is tracked in [OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md](OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md), with command-level scope in [COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md](COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md) and file-format scope in [FIDELITY_CONTRACT.md](FIDELITY_CONTRACT.md).

## Layered Architecture

```
App.Host (composition root, DI, startup)
  └── App.UI (WPF controls — GridView, dialogs)
       └── Core.Commands (command bus, undo/redo, find/replace service)
       └── Core.Calc (dependency graph, recalc engine, viewport service)
            └── Core.Formula (lexer, parser, AST, evaluator, built-in functions)
                 └── Core.Model (pure data types — Workbook, Sheet, Cell, ScalarValue, CellStyle)
       └── Core.IO (file adapters — XLSX via ClosedXML, CSV, native JSON)
            └── Core.Model
```

**Dependency rule**: No `Core.*` project may reference any `App.*` project. This is enforced by project references.

## Key Principles

1. **UI depends on Core; Core never depends on UI.** The formula engine and workbook model run from unit tests with no UI.
2. **One source of truth: the engine.** UI sends commands; the engine mutates state; UI re-renders from `IViewportService`.
3. **Every mutation is a command.** No direct setters on the workbook from outside the engine. This gives undo/redo for free.
4. **The engine owns the dependency graph.** The `calc-chain` in `.xlsx` files is ignored — we build our own.
5. **File adapters are translation layers only.** No business logic in `Core.IO`.

## Current Implemented Baseline

- **Core.Model**: `Workbook`, `Sheet`, `Cell`, `ScalarValue` hierarchy (`BlankValue`, `NumberValue`, `BoolValue`, `TextValue`, `DateTimeValue`, `ErrorValue`), `CellAddress` (A1 notation), `GridRange`, `CellStyle` with `StyleId` registry
- **Core.Formula**: Lexer → Parser → AST → Evaluator; 345 in-scope Excel built-in functions; dynamic arrays; LET/LAMBDA higher-order functions; cross-sheet reference support (`Sheet1!A1`)
- **Core.Calc**: `DependencyGraph` (topological sort, Kahn's algorithm, cycle detection), `RecalcEngine` (volatile-cell support), `ViewportService`
- **Core.Commands**: `ICommandBus` with undo/redo stack, `EditCellsCommand`, `AddSheetCommand`, `RenameSheetCommand`, `FindReplaceService`
- **Core.IO**: `NativeJsonAdapter` (.fxl), `XlsxFileAdapter` (ClosedXML 0.105.0), `CsvFileAdapter`
- **App.UI**: `GridView` — virtualized DrawingContext rendering, selection, row/column headers
- **App.Host**: `MainWindow` — formula bar, scrollbars, open/save dialogs, keyboard navigation, Find & Replace

Native `.fxl` files are versioned JSON documents. Current files declare `FileFormat = Freexcel.NativeJsonWorkbook`,
`SchemaVersion = 1`, and `MinimumReaderVersion = 1`; unversioned legacy files remain readable and are migrated to the
current header on save, while future schema versions are rejected until an explicit migration is implemented.

## Commands Parity Architecture

The May 2026 commands parity closeout keeps command mutation in `Core.Commands` and UI orchestration in `App.Host`.
Clipboard, paste, Format Painter, AutoFit, Format Cells, and Flash Fill are command-first features with undoable
model changes and focused planner/service tests. Rendering-only concerns, such as clipboard marquee, shrink-to-fit
text bounds, and deferred chart display, stay in `App.UI` or `App.Host`.
Border gallery presets are modeled as reusable `StyleDiff` planners in `Core.Commands`; `App.Host` only maps menu
choices to those planners and batches perimeter presets into one undoable command.
Cell Style gallery commands use `App.Host` preset planners that return deterministic `StyleDiff` values for supported
font, fill, border, number-format, and alignment fields. They intentionally do not create workbook named styles or bind
to the workbook theme model, so theme-aware named-style semantics remain a parity gap.

Custom number formatting remains centralized in `Core.Calc.NumberFormatter`. It treats the `General` format token
case-insensitively and parses semicolon-delimited sections
into color, optional invariant numeric condition with signed/scientific thresholds and optional whitespace around
operators/thresholds, optional whitespace between leading color/condition directives, and cleaned format text before delegating to the existing numeric,
date/time, fraction, scientific, and text renderers. This keeps display behavior deterministic across machines while
supporting common Excel custom-format constructs such as conditional sections, named colors, default indexed `ColorN`
color prefixes with optional whitespace inside the bracket token, escaped literals including escaped layout directive characters, escaped section delimiters, and escaped
numeric-placeholder characters inside quoted-affix formats, explicit empty negative/zero positional sections and selected empty conditional date/time sections that suppress display, comma scaling, fixed and variable-denominator fractions, date/time, elapsed-time,
active `?` placeholder alignment spaces for ordinary integer/decimal numeric formats and numerator/denominator fraction fields, active percent scaling that preserves token placement and ignores quoted and escaped percent literals, text placeholders in either the fourth section or a single `@` section, explicit empty fourth text sections that suppress text display, text-section spacing/fill directives, visible currency symbols carried by LCID tokens including multi-character symbols in accounting fill-space patterns, and width-aware fill expansion for active `*` directives when the viewport supplies a column character width. Escaped `*` and `_` characters remain literals and do not trigger target-width expansion. Existing formatter calls without a target width continue to return compact deterministic text for clipboard, formulas, charts, and tests that do not need layout spacing. Localized currency names and workbook palette/theme overrides remain explicit parity gaps. Color prefixes and invariant numeric conditions are parsed at the section boundary and can
color numeric, date/time, and text-section display results. Color-token extraction only consumes recognized custom-format
colors, so elapsed-time bracket tokens such as `[h]`, `[m]`, and `[s]` remain available to the time formatter.
Date/time format conversion supports long and compact
AM/PM markers, disambiguates Excel `m`/`mm` tokens as minutes when adjacent to hour or second tokens across quoted
literals and bracket metadata, maps five-`m` month tokens to month initials, and rounds `.0`/`.00`/`.000`
fractional-second display to the requested precision for both clock time and elapsed-time formats. Elapsed-time
formats are shared by numeric serials and `DateTimeValue` serials so grid display is independent of which scalar type
holds the workbook value. Excel's special `[$-F800]` and `[$-F400]` tokens map to the current OS/.NET culture long-date and
long-time patterns for both date values and numeric date serials, matching their system-format role in Excel while
leaving explicit LCID separator mappings deterministic. The formatter also maps modeled LCIDs `401`, `402`, `404`, `405`, `406`,
`407`, `408`, `409`, `40A`, `40B`, `40C`, `40D`, `40E`, `410`, `411`, `412`, `413`, `414`, `415`, `416`, `418`, `419`, `41A`, `41B`, `41D`, `41E`, `41F`, `420`, `421`, `422`, `424`, `425`, `426`, `427`, `429`, `42A`, `42B`, `42C`, `434`, `435`, `436`, `437`, `439`, `43F`, `440`, `441`, `443`, `43E`, `450`, `453`, `454`, `455`, `45B`, `45E`, `461`, `463`, `468`, `46A`, `470`, `492`, `804`, `807`, `809`, `80A`, `813`, `816`, `100A`, `C01`, `C04`, `C09`, `C0C`, `C0A`, `1009`, `100C`, `1409`, `140A`, `1801`, `1809`, `180A`, `1C09`, `1C0A`, `200A`, `241A`, `240A`, `280A`, `280C`, `2C0A`, `300A`, `340A`, `3801`, `380A`, `380C`, `3C0A`, `400A`, `4009`, `445`, `447`, `449`, `44A`, `44E`, `440A`, and `500A` to deterministic decimal/group/date separators. The catalog can also carry non-Western group-size patterns, currently used for Indian grouping under `4009` (`en-IN`) plus native Indian LCIDs such as `439`, `445`, `449`, `44A`, and `44E`. For LCIDs that .NET can resolve, date/time format info starts from the platform culture so day and month names localize correctly, then Freexcel reapplies the curated separator overrides. The default indexed custom-format palette maps `Color1` through `Color56`; workbook
palette and theme overrides remain outside the formatter boundary. If an LCID token is not in the curated catalog,
`NumberFormatter` falls back fully to .NET `CultureInfo` number/date formats for that LCID. Curated entries stay
authoritative for separators and grouping because they model Excel-specific or tested Freexcel decisions; platform
globalization data broadens display for otherwise-unknown locale tokens and localized date names. Date serial rendering
keeps Gregorian calendar semantics when the resolved culture permits it, since Freexcel's date serials follow Excel's
Gregorian serial-date model; output may still differ from Excel in edge locales or accounting-specific conventions.
The Format Cells Number tab uses the same formatter for its sample preview instead of a separate hardcoded preview
table when category controls synthesize a number format. Its Date and Time type lists expose the Excel `[$-F800]`
long-date and `[$-F400]` long-time special codes, but still delegate actual OS-localized rendering to
`NumberFormatter`. The Special category uses Excel-like labels such as Zip Code and Social Security Number as UI
aliases only; the dialog resolves them back to ordinary custom number-format codes before commands mutate cell styles.
Representative number, date/time, and text values keep the dialog preview aligned with the grid rendering path while
avoiding any new UI-specific formatter behavior.

Conditional Formatting authoring is split between lightweight WPF dialogs in `App.Host` and the `Core.Model`
`ConditionalFormat` model consumed by commands and XLSX IO. The rule manager clones the full modeled rule state
when editing or reordering so advanced rules such as color scales, data bars, icon sets, Top/Bottom, text, and date
rules do not lose fields even though full Excel manager UI and icon rendering taxonomy remain partial.

Advanced chart families are recognized as `ChartType` values and marked non-renderable through `ChartTypeSupport`.
Authoring commands reject them before mutation, `ChartRenderer` returns no plot model for them, and the Insert UI routes
them to a deferred message. XLSX parsing recognizes common advanced chart package shapes where enough range metadata is
available, but lossless mixed drawing-part writing remains deferred until each family has a data model and writer.

PDF and XPS export share the WPF `PrintRenderer` so exported files match print preview layout. PDF export is implemented
through `PDFsharp-WPF` by rasterizing each `FixedDocument` page into a same-sized PDF page, then layering a simple vector
text overlay for `TextBlock` content so exported worksheet text can be selected or searched while the raster page remains
the visual source of truth. The overlay extractor walks panel, decorator, and content-control wrappers so text nested
inside common WPF containers participates, and it flattens simple `TextBlock` `Run` and `LineBreak` inlines into the
same overlay stream, including `Run`/`LineBreak` content nested inside common `Span` derivatives such as bold and
italic inline containers. WPF `AccessText` labels are also extracted with access-key underscores normalized out so searchable
PDF text matches the rendered label, and simple `TextBox` content is extracted with padding-aware positioning for
form-like fixed-document content. Simple non-UIElement content on WPF `ContentControl` elements such as labels is
extracted through the same string value WPF renders, while UIElement content continues through the traversal path. Simple
non-UIElement headers and UIElement headers on `HeaderedContentControl` elements such as group boxes are also extracted.
Simple non-UIElement items on
`ItemsControl` derivatives are emitted as overlay text through the same string value WPF renders for search and
selection while the raster page remains authoritative for item layout. Simple WPF `Glyphs.UnicodeString` runs are extracted as well,
using the glyph font URI name when present and an Arial overlay fallback otherwise. These text overlays improve select/search behavior without
promoting the whole PDF renderer to vector graphics. The Excel-like bitmap-text publish option is modeled on
`ExportOptions`; when selected it
keeps the raster page and suppresses the selectable text overlay for PDF output, matching the user's preference for
bitmap-only text when embedded-font fidelity is more important than search/select behavior. XPS export remains a separate ReachFramework-backed
path for Windows print-pipeline workflows. `ExportOptions` models active-sheet, selected-range, entire-workbook, and
one-based page-range scopes; selected-range export is implemented by passing a `GridRange` override into `PrintRenderer`,
workbook export combines visible worksheet documents rendered through the same sheet-level path, PDF page ranges subset
the fixed-document pages directly, XPS page ranges wrap the renderer's `DocumentPaginator`, and the Excel-style
standard/minimum-size quality option is modeled explicitly. The Excel-style "Ignore print areas" option is modeled on
`ExportOptions` and flows into `PrintRenderer`; selected-range export still wins by passing an explicit range override,
while active-sheet and workbook export can bypass each sheet's stored `PrintArea` and render the used range. PDF export
honors the quality choice by changing raster page DPI while preserving the physical page size; XPS keeps the
print-pipeline paginator path. `ExportPlanner`
validates requested page ranges against the rendered page count before file creation, so out-of-range requests surface
as export-option errors instead of half-written files. Extensionless export paths are normalized to `.pdf` when PDF is
inferred and to `.xps` when the save dialog explicitly selects XPS; explicit PDF/XPS save-dialog choices also replace
mismatched extensions so the written bytes and visible filename agree. PDF sheet-name bookmarks are modeled on `ExportOptions` and written through
`PdfDocument.Outlines`; bookmark targets are filtered and re-indexed after page-range selection so exported outlines
only point at pages that exist in the final PDF. Bookmark modes now distinguish sheet-name bookmarks, print-title
bookmarks derived from modeled repeated rows/columns with sheet-name fallback, and per-page number bookmarks. Bookmark-bearing PDFs request outline navigation through
`/PageMode /UseOutlines` and `/NonFullScreenPageMode /UseOutlines`. Bookmarks are intentionally PDF-only: the export options dialog labels
them as PDF bookmarks, and XPS request summaries report selected bookmarks as PDF-only instead of silently treating XPS
as bookmark-capable. Likewise, XPS request summaries report the minimum-size quality choice as PDF-only because XPS uses
the fixed-document print pipeline instead of the PDF raster-DPI path, and report bitmap-text requests as PDF-only because
XPS is already written through the fixed-document package path. Full Excel document-property fidelity,
full Excel PDF publish options,
and full vectorization beyond simple text overlays remain parity gaps.
When `IncludeDocumentProperties` is selected for PDF output, `App.Host` maps the current `Workbook` into
`PdfDocumentProperties` and writes the supported PDF Info dictionary fields. The current modeled subset is intentionally
small: workbook name becomes the PDF title and deterministic Freexcel values fill author, subject, keywords, and creator.
PDF creator metadata still identifies Freexcel on all generated PDFs; the exporter trims explicit PDF Info field values
and skips blank values before writing, so workbook-derived and future explicit metadata paths share one normalization
boundary. Generated PDFs default `/Lang` to deterministic `en-US` catalog metadata. The export options dialog exposes
that language tag as a normalized PDF-only option; known .NET culture tags are canonicalized from user input, including
underscore-to-hyphen cleanup and casing, invalid or blank tags fall back to `en-US`, and the normalized value flows
through `ExportOptions.PdfLanguage` into the PDF catalog `/Lang` entry without affecting XPS package metadata. When a nonblank title is written, the exporter
also sets PDF viewer preferences to display the document title instead of the file name. Generated PDFs also set
`/PrintScaling /None` in viewer preferences so print dialogs that honor
the flag default to actual-size output instead of silently scaling exported worksheets, and set `/PageLayout /SinglePage`
by default so readers open exports in a predictable page-at-a-time view. Export options can override the initial PDF
layout to one-column or two-column variants and can request normal, bookmark-pane, or full-screen opening mode. They also set `/FitWindow` and `/CenterWindow` viewer
preferences as best-effort hints for PDF readers that honor window framing metadata, and `/PickTrayByPDFSize` so
print workflows can choose paper trays from exported worksheet page sizes when the reader/printer honors the hint. The option controls the additional
workbook-derived fields. XPS export writes the same modeled
title/creator/subject/keywords subset into the package core
properties when the option is selected and applies the same trim-and-skip normalization policy at the final
package-property boundary. This keeps document-property export useful without introducing a full Office
document-property subsystem.

PivotTable authoring remains model-first and worksheet-range only. `Core.Commands` owns undoable creation and refresh:
current-sheet insertion uses `AddPivotTableCommand`, while new-worksheet insertion uses `AddPivotTableToNewWorksheetCommand`
to create a unique PivotTable sheet, anchor the report at `A3`, and delegate cache/table materialization to the same
refresh path. `PivotTableRefreshService` also owns materialized value-cell formatting: supported built-in value-field
`numFmtId` values are resolved through `Core.Model.BuiltInNumberFormatCatalog` to `CellStyle.NumberFormat` codes before
PivotStyle visual styling is merged in, so number formats survive body, subtotal, grand-total, and stripe styling. Custom
PivotTable value-field number formats use
`Workbook.NumberFormatCatalog` for XLSX `numFmtId >= 164` entries; loaded data fields keep both the ID and resolved
format code, and authored catalogs are written back to `styles.xml`. When a generated stylesheet already uses a requested
custom ID for another format, the PivotTable catalog entry is remapped to the next free custom ID and authored or
source-preserved PivotTable XML is rewritten to match. The Value Field Settings dialog exposes a broad set of common
Excel-style built-in format presets covering integer/decimal number formats, comma and red-negative variants,
currency and accounting variants, short and long dates, time and elapsed-time formats, percentage, fraction, scientific, and text
formats while keeping the raw `numFmtId` override for loaded or advanced cases and editing custom format codes,
assigning authored custom codes to the workbook catalog path. Each preset gets its concrete format code from
`BuiltInNumberFormatCatalog`, so selecting a label such as Currency opens the nested Format Cells editor on the same
`$#,##0.00` code that refresh uses for `numFmtId=7`. Choosing a built-in preset clears any hidden custom format code left by the nested editor, preventing
stale custom codes from overriding the visible preset. When the nested editor returns a code that exactly matches a
known built-in preset, the dialog stores the built-in `numFmtId` instead of promoting that code to a custom catalog ID.
Duplicate preset aliases keep loaded or typed labels compatible, but the first preset for a built-in ID is the canonical
display label used when reopening the dialog.
`PivotTableModel.EmptyValueText` models Excel's "For empty cells show" option for generated matrix reports:
`PivotTableRefreshService` writes the configured text only for row/column intersections with no source rows, while
real zero aggregates, row totals, column totals, and grand totals remain numeric so formatting and calculations stay
predictable. Sheet cloning carries the option with the rest of the PivotTable model state. `PivotTableOptionsDialog`
and `ConfigurePivotTableOptionsCommand` are the command surface for editing this value; both normalize whitespace-only
input back to `null`, and the command snapshots the option with the rest of the PivotTable settings so undo restores
the previous rendered matrix.
Pivot cache data options remain owned by `PivotCacheModel`, not duplicated onto `PivotTableModel`. `PivotTableOptionsDialog`
reads the cache connected by `PivotTableModel.CacheId`, and `ConfigurePivotTableOptionsCommand` updates the cache's
`RefreshOnLoad`, `SaveData`, `EnableRefresh`, and `MissingItemsLimit` settings with undoable snapshots. The deleted-item
retention option follows OOXML's `missingItemsLimit`: `null` omits the attribute for Automatic, `0` means None, and the
dialog/command path normalizes positive selections to Excel's Maximum sentinel (`1,048,576`). This keeps XLSX cache
metadata, dialog state, and command mutation aligned while leaving external/OLAP cache execution out of scope.
The PivotTable Options style picker exposes the built-in `PivotStyleLight1..28`, `PivotStyleMedium1..28`, and
`PivotStyleDark1..28` name ranges and appends the workbook's current authored style name when it is outside that
built-in list. This avoids destructive style-name fallback when a loaded workbook uses a custom style while keeping the
visual renderer intentionally lightweight: `PivotStylePaletteResolver` maps selected built-in names to modeled header,
subtotal, grand-total, stripe, and border colors. When a workbook uses a custom theme, the supported Medium/Dark family
subset resolves its base color from workbook theme accent slots and derives subtotal, grand-total, stripe, and border
colors through the same tint helper used by other theme-color references. The Office default keeps the existing fixed
palette snapshots for compatibility with current tests and loaded workbooks. Matrix row-grand-total columns are detected
from the header band and receive the same grand-total body styling as grand-total rows, while header cells keep
header-style precedence. Exact Excel table-style XML semantics and every built-in style's precise theme slot/tint recipe
remain partial.
`PivotTableModel.CompactRowLabelIndent` models Excel's compact-layout row-label indentation as style state instead of
embedding padding spaces into cell text. `PivotTableRefreshService` applies the configured indent to materialized compact
row-label cells after PivotTable visual styles, so the option composes with built-in style palettes and number-format
preservation. The PivotTable Options dialog clamps user-entered indentation to Excel's supported 0-15 style range, the
options command snapshots it for undo, sheet cloning carries it with the rest of the PivotTable model, and XLSX load/save
maps it through the pivot table definition `indent` attribute.
Nested PivotTable subtotal captions use the item from the field being subtotaled rather than always using the first row
field. This matters for compact reports with three or more row fields, where grouped `Region / Quarter / Channel`
outputs subtotal `Quarter` groups as `Q1 Total` or `Q2 Total` instead of repeating the outer `Region` caption for every
nested subtotal. `PivotTableModel.ShowFieldHeaders` models Excel's "Display field captions and filter drop-downs" option and maps to the
native `showHeaders` attribute. `PivotTableModel.ShowContextualTooltips` and
`PivotTableModel.ShowPropertiesInTooltips` model the PivotTable display tooltip options and map to native
`showDataTips` and `showMemberPropertyTips`. `PivotTableModel.ShowClassicLayout` models Excel's classic drag-in-grid
layout option and maps to native `showDropZones`. `PivotTableModel.MergeAndCenterLabels` models Excel's merge-label
layout option and maps to native `mergeItem`; refresh materializes it for non-compact row-label output by merging
contiguous repeated outer labels inside the PivotTable target range, including hidden-repeat continuation rows when
`RepeatItemLabels` is disabled, and clearing stale PivotTable-owned merges before each refresh. `RepeatItemLabels`
and `BlankLineAfterItems` are honored by both row-only and row-plus-column matrix PivotTable materialization so outer
row labels and spacer rows behave consistently across report shapes. Exact Excel
merged-label behavior for compact layout, subtotals, and all visual centering details remains separate visual fidelity
work. `PivotTableModel.ShowExpandCollapseButtons` models Excel's on-screen PivotTable
expand/collapse button visibility separately from `PrintExpandCollapseButtons`. This follows OOXML's split between
`showDrill` for display state and `printDrill` for print output. `ConfigurePivotTableOptionsCommand` snapshots these
display/print flags independently, the Options dialog places display flags on the Display tab and the print flag on the
Printing tab, sheet cloning carries them, and XLSX load/save round-trips the attributes without deriving values from one
another.
`PivotTableModel.PageOverThenDown` and `PivotTableModel.PageWrap` model Excel's report-filter field layout controls and
map to native `pageOverThenDown` and `pageWrap` attributes. They are surfaced through the PivotTable Options layout tab,
snapshotted by `ConfigurePivotTableOptionsCommand`, cloned with the sheet, and persisted through XLSX. The current grid
materialization writes page-field captions and selected-item text above the pivot body, using the modeled over-then-down
or down-then-over wrap order and leaving a blank row before the row/column/data-field body begins. PivotStyle rendering
uses that shifted body start for header, stripe, subtotal, grand-total, and compact-indent calculations so report-filter
rows do not steal body header styling.
`PivotTableModel.AutofitColumnsOnUpdate` and `PivotTableModel.PreserveFormattingOnUpdate` model the two Excel
PivotTable Options format checkboxes that control update-time width and formatting behavior. They are stored as
PivotTable state, surfaced through `PivotTableOptionsDialog`, preserved by quick option commands when omitted,
snapshotted for undo, cloned with the sheet, and round-tripped through OOXML `applyWidthHeightFormats` and
`preserveFormatting` attributes. The current implementation records and preserves the user intent; full Excel
refresh-time layout heuristics remain separate from the option-state fidelity.
External/OLAP/data-model caches stay excluded from
execution; their package metadata is retained where covered by XLSX fidelity paths.
PivotCharts remain normal `ChartModel` instances bound back to `PivotTableModel` by name/cache metadata. The chart model
keeps a master `ShowPivotChartFieldButtons` switch plus per-button report-filter, axis-field, and value-field visibility
flags. `ChartRenderer` and `GridView` both honor the same flags, so rendered annotations and click targets stay aligned
when a user hides only one class of PivotChart field button. The PivotChart Options command is the owning mutation path
for these flags: `ConfigurePivotChartOptionsCommand` snapshots the master and per-button visibility booleans with the
chart style ID so undo restores the complete field-button state, while the host dialog exposes the same booleans rather
than keeping hidden UI-only state. Native JSON persists the PivotChart binding fields, chart style ID, field-button
visibility flags, and modeled chart design metadata such as pivot format XML, date-system/language, manual layouts,
external-data pointers, protection, print settings, rounded corners, blank display, and hidden-row display flags so
Freexcel-authored workbooks do not lose chart option state outside XLSX.
Slicer and timeline metadata stays model-first for filters/cache linkage, with native floating drawing parts preserved
best-effort by package merge. For native drawing fidelity, `Core.IO` reads `twoCellAnchor` coordinates and nonvisual
shape names from related worksheet drawing parts into nullable `DrawingAnchor` and `DrawingShapeName` metadata on
`SlicerModel` and `TimelineModel`. Freexcel does not yet redraw native slicer/timeline controls from these anchors, but
the coordinates and shape names survive model load for future rendering and diagnostics while unsupported drawing XML
remains package-preserved.

Structured table authoring stays command-owned. `CreateStructuredTableCommand` creates the model metadata and
`CreateStyledStructuredTableCommand` layers visible banding as one undoable operation. Loaded table totals metadata is
materialized by `RefreshStructuredTableTotalsCommand`, which writes totals-row labels, explicit totals formulas as text,
and common Excel totals functions (`sum`, `average`, `count`, `countNums`, `min`, and `max`) from the table data rows.
The command snapshots affected totals-row cells for undo. Basic structured-reference formulas are resolved from
`StructuredTableModel` metadata at formula evaluation and dependency-registration time through
`StructuredReferenceResolver`; formulas keep their `TableName[ColumnName]` shape instead of being rewritten to A1 ranges.
The evaluator carries the formula cell address in its context so current-row references can resolve relative to the
hosting table data row. The supported slice covers same-workbook data-body column references such as `Sales[Amount]`,
whole-table section selectors `#Headers`, `#Data`, `#All`, and `#Totals`, common section-column intersections such as
`Sales[[#Totals],[Amount]]`, and scalar current-row references such as `[@Amount]` or `Sales[@Amount]` when the formula
cell is inside the table data body. Data-body and section-scoped multi-column ranges such as `Sales[[Amount]:[Tax]]`
and `Sales[[#Data],[Amount]:[Tax]]` resolve to rectangular table ranges. Excel's `#This Row` selector resolves through
the same current-cell context as `[@Column]`, including row-scoped column ranges such as
`Sales[[#This Row],[Amount]:[Tax]]`. Unqualified `#This Row` selectors bind to the containing table for calculated
column-style formulas, for example `[[#This Row],[Amount]:[Tax]]`. Current-row references outside a table data row,
external workbook structured references, and full table style theme semantics remain outside this slice.

Flash Fill remains a deterministic pattern service, not an Excel-like ML inference engine. It supports conservative
single-column transforms including dotted/underscored/hyphenated email display-name cleanup, plus a small multi-column
pattern set. First/last-name, first-initial/last-name, and last-name/first-initial email generation learn constant
domains and modeled `.`, `_`, or `-` separators from examples. It returns no result when the examples are ambiguous.

Spell Check remains a deterministic known-corrections service in `Core.Commands`, not dictionary-backed proofing. It
scans literal text cells in sheet/row/column order and plans undoable replacement edits while leaving formula cells alone.

Accessibility Checker remains a deterministic model-backed audit in `Core.Commands`, not a full WCAG or screen-reader
engine. It reports issues supported by current workbook state, including merged cells, missing object alternate text,
hidden sheets/rows/columns with content, unclear hyperlink display text, and charts whose title is missing as the
current accessible label.

Selection Pane object editing uses lightweight `Name` fields on charts, pictures, text boxes, and drawing shapes.
Generated names remain the fallback when no explicit name is modeled. Visibility, z-order, and rename edits stay in
`Core.Commands`; `RenameSelectionPaneObjectCommand` snapshots the previous name for undo, while the host dialog only
plans rename/visibility/move changes and applies them through the command bus as one `CompositeWorkbookCommand`, so a
single dialog acceptance is one undo step. Native JSON persists modeled object names. XLSX drawing object name
load/save maps the drawing non-visual `cNvPr/@name` value for charts, pictures, text boxes, and drawing shapes to
the modeled object name, while deeper Office drawing IDs and other non-visual metadata remain best-effort package
details rather than first-class model state.

The Backstage File > Info panel is a host-only summary surface over existing model services. It reads
`WorkbookStatisticsService` and `AccessibilityCheckerService`, then formats protection/status copy through
`InfoPanelSummaryPlanner` when the Info view opens. It does not introduce cloud account, version-history,
template, Document Inspector, or extended document-metadata subsystems.

Error Checking remains a deterministic model-backed audit in `Core.Commands`, not a full Excel heuristic inference
engine. It reports cached formula error values, text cells that parse as finite invariant-culture numbers, and formulas
whose direct parser-extracted precedents include missing or blank cells. Rule toggles use
`Workbook.DisabledFormulaErrorCodes`, and per-cell ignore state reuses `Cell.IgnoreFormulaError` for both formula-error
and non-error issue kinds.

XLSX worksheet `ignoredErrors` fidelity uses that same `Cell.IgnoreFormulaError` bit as the modeled state. `Core.IO`
loads supported active `ignoredError` `sqref` cells/ranges into the bit and authors a conservative modeled
`ignoredErrors` block on save; detailed native ignored-error flags and unsupported reference forms are retained or
merged best-effort from the source package rather than fully interpreted.

XLSX worksheet `cellWatches` fidelity uses `Workbook.WatchedCells` as the durable modeled state shared with the
Watch Window services. `Core.IO` loads supported single-cell A1 `cellWatch/@r` refs with sheet IDs, skips malformed
refs without creating cells, and authors grouped worksheet `cellWatches` blocks on save. Native-only watch attributes
and unsupported entries are merged best-effort from the source package by matching `r` refs so modeled watches do not
duplicate retained source watches.

XLSX custom-view fidelity uses `Workbook.CustomViews` as the durable modeled state shared with Custom Views commands,
Native JSON, and the host dialog. `Core.IO` loads workbook `customWorkbookView` name/GUID entries only when matching
worksheet `customSheetView` entries provide view state that Freexcel can represent: view mode, simple frozen/split
panes, gridline/headings/ruler/formula visibility, and zoom. The optional custom-view ID is persisted in the model for
stable XLSX GUID round-trip. Source-package merge treats modeled GUIDs as authoritative while preserving native-only
attributes and retaining unmatched native custom views best-effort; print settings, filter state, hidden row/column
snapshots, selections, personal-view metadata, and window geometry stay outside the modeled subset.

XLSX worksheet `scenarios` fidelity uses `Workbook.Scenarios` as the durable modeled state shared with the Scenario
Manager commands and UI. `Core.IO` loads supported worksheet `scenario` entries only when every `inputCells/@r` is a
same-sheet A1 cell reference and every changing value is a literal `@val`; load records definitions without applying
them. On save, workbook scenarios are grouped by sheet, so a cross-sheet model scenario becomes one worksheet scenario
entry per touched sheet with the shared scenario name. Source-package merge treats supported scenario names as
model-authoritative, preserving native attributes and safe children for still-modeled scenarios while avoiding
resurrection of removed supported entries; malformed or unsupported native-only scenario entries remain best-effort.

XLSX worksheet custom-property fidelity uses `Sheet.CustomProperties` as the durable modeled state. `Core.IO` loads
supported `customProperties/customPr` name/id pairs, writes them back on save, and persists them through Native JSON.
During source-package merge, supported modeled names are authoritative: matching native attributes and child elements
are copied onto still-modeled properties, removed supported entries are not resurrected, and malformed native-only
property entries remain best-effort.

XLSX worksheet calculation-property fidelity uses `Sheet.FullCalculationOnLoad` as the modeled subset of
`sheetCalcPr`. `Core.IO` loads and writes `sheetCalcPr/@fullCalcOnLoad`, persists it through Native JSON, and treats
the modeled flag as authoritative during source-package merge: native-only attributes and child elements are retained,
but a cleared modeled flag is not restored from the source worksheet.

XLSX worksheet phonetic-property fidelity uses `Sheet.PhoneticProperties` as raw worksheet-level metadata for
`phoneticPr` fontId/type/alignment attributes. Freexcel does not render or edit phonetic text, but `Core.IO` loads,
writes, and persists those stable attributes through Native JSON. Source-package merge treats the modeled attributes as
authoritative while preserving native-only phonetic attributes and child elements best-effort.

XLSX worksheet allow-edit range fidelity uses `Sheet.AllowEditRanges` as the durable modeled state. `Core.IO` loads
supported single-area `protectedRange/@sqref` entries, skips malformed or multi-area entries as native-only metadata,
and writes modeled `protectedRanges` on save. During source-package merge, modeled supported `sqref`s are authoritative:
matching native attributes and child elements are copied onto still-modeled ranges, removed modeled ranges are not
resurrected, and unsupported native-only `protectedRange` entries are retained best-effort.

XLSX worksheet page-break fidelity uses `Sheet.RowPageBreaks` and `Sheet.ColumnPageBreaks` as the durable modeled
state. `Core.IO` lets ClosedXML load and author supported manual row/column break IDs, then merges native attributes
only onto still-modeled matching `<brk>` entries. Removed modeled breaks are not resurrected from the source package,
while malformed or native-only break entries are retained best-effort.

XLSX worksheet print/layout fidelity uses the `Sheet` print options and page setup fields as the durable modeled state.
During source-package metadata merge, `Core.IO` retains only native-only `printOptions` and `pageSetup` attributes such as
printer defaults or copy counts. Modeled attributes for gridlines, headings, centering, orientation, paper, scale,
first-page number, print quality, comment/error printing, black-and-white, and draft quality are not copied back from the
source worksheet when ClosedXML omits or rewrites them. Printer settings binary parts and `pageSetup` relationships stay
owned by the dedicated printer-settings retention path.

## Current Architectural Limitations

- Sheet rename rewrites existing sheet-qualified formula references through the formula AST/serializer path
- `Core.Model` has a workbook theme scaffold with native and XLSX theme-part persistence, loaded-cell-style theme-color resolution, drawing-object theme color references, chart theme-color references/rendering, and an undoable `SetWorkbookThemeCommand`; `Core.IO` has reusable DrawingML color parsing plus minimal worksheet/drawing relationship-based load/save for embedded package parts for every current native chart type, including `twoCellAnchor` chart bounds/EMU offsets, `oneCellAnchor` bounds, `absoluteAnchor` bounds, no-header and no-category-column series range semantics, chart title/range with title text color/font size, axis titles with text color/font size, value-axis bounds/units/log-scale/number formats, axis gridline visibility/color/thickness, tick marks, axis label visibility, axis line color/thickness, legend visibility/position/text/fill/border/theme-text/font-size, global data-label visibility/position/content/number-format/fill/border/text/font/rotation/callout baseline, per-point data-label fill/border/text/font formatting, trendline type/equation/R-squared/line formatting, common column/area combo line-overlay and column/area/line/scatter secondary-value-axis package state, chart/plot area fill and plot border, bar direction/grouping, scatter/bubble X/Y ranges and value-axis pairs, bubble-size ranges, pie/doughnut first-slice angle and exploded-slice package state, doughnut hole size, line/scatter series color-width-dash-marker and marker-fill package formatting, and filled-series fill/outline color-width-dash package formatting; `App.Host` exposes initial Page Layout Themes, Colors, Fonts, and Effects preset dropdowns plus a custom theme dialog for name, heading/body fonts, effects, and core color slots, and `App.UI` renders Subtle/Refined drawing-object shadow effects while deeper OOXML effect semantics and richer chart formatting remain future work
- CSV adapter does not handle quoted fields or multi-line cells
- Volatile function tracking is not thread-safe (single UI thread assumed)
- Style registry uses linear scan (acceptable for v1 style counts)
