# Freexcel XLSX Test Corpus Plan

**Status:** Executable scaffold active  
**Last updated:** 2026-05-17  
**Goal:** Build a 100+ workbook corpus that measures whether Freexcel preserves supported Excel workbook content while clearly reporting excluded or deferred features.

## Acceptance Target

- Minimum corpus size: 100 `.xlsx` files.
- Release target: at least 95% of corpus files open and save without data loss for supported modeled features.
- Reporting unit: one workbook counts as pass only when all supported feature checks pass for that workbook.
- Unsupported-package content is not a failure when Freexcel detects it and reports it through the documented warning path before save.

## Corpus Buckets

| Bucket | Count | Purpose | Required Checks |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Basic grid data | 20 | Plain workbooks with numbers, text, blanks, booleans, dates, and errors | Values, sheet names, dimensions |
| Formulas | 20 | Common arithmetic, aggregate, lookup, date/time, text, logical, and cross-sheet formulas | Formula text, cached values when present, recalc result |
| Formatting | 15 | Fonts, fills, borders, alignment, wrapping, number formats, style-only empty cells | Style IDs, rendered display text, cell style properties |
| Structure | 10 | Multiple sheets, hidden rows/columns, row heights, column widths, freeze panes, merged regions | Sheet metadata, layout metadata |
| Named ranges and validation | 10 | Defined names, list validation, numeric/date/text/custom validation, input/error messages | Native model records, XLSX round-trip |
| Conditional formatting | 10 | Modeled conditional-format rules plus unsupported rules that must be disclosed/skipped | Supported rules preserved, unsupported rules reported |
| Objects and links | 10 | Comments, hyperlinks, images, text boxes, basic shapes, sparklines | Native objects, warning behavior for unsupported records |
| Charts | 10 | Native supported chart families and richer unsupported package chart parts | Supported native chart model, explicit unsupported warnings |
| Protection and page setup | 5 | Sheet/workbook protection, allow-edit ranges, margins, print areas, scaling | Protection/page setup model properties |

Total planned minimum: 110 files. The extra 10 files provide slack for corrupted, duplicate, or license-ineligible samples.

## Source Mix

| Source | Target Count | Inclusion Rules |
|---|---:|---|
| Locally generated fixtures | 37 | Created by deterministic tests or helper scripts; no external license risk. |
| Public government/open-data spreadsheets | 25 | Must have explicit public/open license; retain source URL and retrieval date in manifest. |
| Public sample workbooks from library/vendor docs | 20 | Must allow test redistribution or be generated from documented examples. |
| User-provided local workbooks | 20 | Must be approved for local testing; manifest stores only filename, feature tags, and anonymized notes unless user allows more detail. |
| Regression workbooks from fixed bugs | 10 | Minimal workbooks committed with tests when they reproduce a specific fixed behavior. |

## Repository Layout

Keep binary samples out of source control until license and size policies are decided.

```text
test-corpus/
  README.md
  manifest.csv
  generated/
  public/
  local-private/
  regressions/
```

`local-private/` must remain ignored by Git. Public and regression samples can be committed only after confirming redistribution rights.

## Manifest Schema

`test-corpus/manifest.csv` should use these columns:

```csv
id,path,source_type,source_url,retrieved_on,license,feature_tags,expected_warnings,expected_status,notes
```

Allowed `source_type` values:

- `generated`
- `public`
- `local-private`
- `regression`

Allowed `expected_status` values:

- `supported-pass`
- `supported-known-gap`
- `excluded-warning-pass`
- `corrupt-or-invalid`

## Round-Trip Check Procedure

1. Open the workbook through `XlsxFileAdapter`.
2. Capture a feature summary from the loaded `Workbook` model.
3. Save to a temporary `.xlsx`.
4. Reopen the saved file.
5. Compare supported model features against the first loaded model.
6. Verify expected unsupported/excluded warnings were emitted.
7. Record pass/fail by workbook and by feature bucket.

## Required Report

The Sprint 2 report should be written to `docs/XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md` and include:

- Corpus size and bucket counts.
- Pass rate by workbook.
- Pass rate by feature bucket.
- Top 10 failures by user impact.
- Unsupported/excluded feature warning counts.
- A prioritized fix list mapped back to `docs/COMMAND_SURFACE_PARITY.md`.

## First Implementation Tasks

1. [x] Create `test-corpus/README.md` explaining the folder policy and license rules.
2. [x] Create `test-corpus/manifest.csv` with the schema above and generated fixture rows.
3. [x] Add an ignored `test-corpus/local-private/` entry to `.gitignore`.
4. [x] Add a non-networked corpus runner test that reads the manifest and skips missing private files.
5. [x] Generate the first 10 deterministic workbooks from existing model APIs.
6. [x] Run the corpus runner locally and publish the first `docs/XLSX_CORPUS_REPORT.md`.

## Exclusions Are Not Failures

The following content should count as a pass only when detected and disclosed, not when silently preserved:

- VBA projects and macros.
- Slicers and timelines.
- Microsoft 365 Share/co-authoring state.
- Power Query, Power Pivot, data model relationships, and OLAP artifacts.
- Embedded/OLE objects and custom package parts outside the Freexcel model.
