# Excel Dialog Parity Wave 2 Plan

## Status

Wave 1 replaces prompt-driven workbook operations with local modal dialogs for formatting, navigation, sorting/filtering, data tools, scenarios, protection, and validation range selection.

Wave 2 first pass is implemented for local chart, PivotTable/PivotChart, object/picture, Page Setup, Name Manager, Data Validation, Paste Special, and Selection Pane entry points. The remaining Wave 2 items are deeper Excel galleries, full-format panes, or workbook-model behaviors that need richer models, renderer support, or larger UI surfaces.

## Implemented First Pass

- Insert Chart / Recommended Charts picker.
- PivotChart Change Type dialog.
- PivotTable creation dialog with source, destination, and field-list options.
- PivotTable Change Data Source dialog.
- Insert Slicer and Insert Timeline dialogs.
- Hyperlink dialog.
- Picture/object size, rotation, crop, shape gradient, alt text, comment, and text box entry dialogs.
- Shape gradient start/end color picker buttons.
- Data Validation Settings/Input Message/Error Alert tabs.
- Paste Special operation radio-button group.
- Selection Pane show/hide all and visibility/order controls.
- Page Setup reuse for custom margins, scaling, and print titles.
- Name Manager reuse for Define Name.

   - [Done first pass] Hyperlink and comment/note dialogs where workbook objects need non-cell editing surfaces.

   - [Existing/partial] Border gallery presets, line styles, diagonal borders, and live preview integration.

## Verification Expectations

- Each dialog surface gets planner or model tests before wiring to `MainWindow`.
- UI-only XAML coverage should verify required tabs, controls, and command routing.
- Any dialog that edits workbook state must have at least one command-level test proving the selected options are honored.
- WPF tests should be run with stale `Freexcel.App.Host` processes cleared first to avoid locked build outputs.
