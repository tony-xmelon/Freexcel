# Freexcel Next Development Phases

**Last updated:** 2026-05-23
**Current state:** Formula engine at 345/345 in-scope functions (100%), command surface at 100% of in-scope commands, XLSX round-trip and corpus coverage continuing to expand, virtualized WPF UI, and deep PivotTable/PivotChart fidelity. The active focus is overlap management across parallel worktrees, ribbon SVG/icon parity, dialog reconciliation, formula hardening, chart/XLSX reader refactors, corpus expansion, release packaging, and the explicitly documented native-Excel pivot edge cases.

## Completed

### Phase 6: Formula Completeness

All 345 in-scope Excel functions are implemented and tested:

- **6A** - LET, LAMBDA, MAP, REDUCE, SCAN, BYROW, BYCOL, MAKEARRAY (+ recursive lambda support)
- **6B** - Full statistical distribution suite (normal, t, F, chi-squared, binomial, beta, gamma, Weibull, lognormal, exponential, FREQUENCY, SKEW, KURT, CONFIDENCE)
- **6C** - Complete financial bond math (accrued interest, coupon analytics, price/yield, odd-period, depreciation, IRR/XIRR/XNPV, treasury bills, and all remaining helpers)
- **6D** - OFFSET, FORMULATEXT, ISFORMULA, ISREF, CELL, INFO, GETPIVOTDATA
- **6E** - HYPERLINK plus discrete engineering base-conversion and bitwise functions

See [FUNCTION_PARITY.md](FUNCTION_PARITY.md) for the full function list.

### PivotTable Fidelity

Core pivot semantics, XLSX round-trip, and refresh propagation are solid:

- Multiple row/column/value/filter fields; nested column matrices
- Grand-total visibility (row and column axes independently)
- Repeated-label suppression; blank-line spacing; compact/outline layout flags
- Page/row/column checked-item filters; row and column label filters; value filters with source-field targeting
- Label and value sorting (both axes); date/number grouping
- Top/bottom subtotals; calculated fields/items; Show Details (item/subtotal/grand-total/matrix/column-only data cells)
- Values-only and column-only layouts
- PivotChart binding; undoable bound chart-type changes; XLSX-authored round-trip; PivotTable style-name round-trip
- GETPIVOTDATA lookups for same-sheet and cross-sheet PivotTable references, page fields, row/column filters, subtotals, and grand totals
- Cross-sheet source data for PivotTable creation, source changes, slicers, timelines, and GETPIVOTDATA
- Insert Slicer and Insert Timeline command/UI authoring for worksheet-range PivotTables

### May 2026 Parallel Parity Push

The late May workstreams moved several remaining parity areas from feature build-out into hardening:

- Command surface remains at 100% coverage for in-scope commands.
- Formula work is now edge-case hardening rather than function coverage, with active Unicode, spill, and scalar coercion fixes.
- XLSX parity has expanded through chart part readers, slicer/timeline anchors, icon-set corpus coverage, public corpus checks, pivot writer refactors, and native JSON chart metadata.
- Dialog parity has broad coverage, but multiple dirty branches still need reconciliation before the surface should be called stable.
- Ribbon icon parity is active in `codex/svg-ribbon-icons` and is currently the largest visible UI overlap point.

---

## Phase 7: Advanced UI Polish (estimated: 2-3 sprints)

### 7-0: Overlap Stabilization

Before opening new broad UI workstreams, finish or explicitly pause the current dirty overlaps:

- Finish `codex/svg-ribbon-icons` or shelve it before further ribbon/layout work.
- Rebase/review `codex/dialog-excel-ux` against current `main` and reconcile it with merged dialog-fidelity work.
- Merge focused formula and chart/XLSX branches after targeted verification.
- Clean generated build/log artifacts from release and main integration worktrees.
- Preserve one owner per shared file family: ribbon shell, dialog shell, pivot dialog/model, XLSX chart readers, formula text functions.

### 7A: PivotTable Authoring UI

The model, refresh engine, and primary authoring layer cover the practical worksheet-range PivotTable surface:

- Field-list panel with checkbox toggles, drag-and-drop into row/column/value/filter zones, context menus, item filters, label/value filters, and Value Field Settings with built-in/custom number-format controls is implemented.
- Contextual PivotTable Analyze/Design tabs include Field List, Refresh, Show Details, PivotChart, Insert Slicer, Insert Timeline, Change Source, layout controls, style cycling, and style-option toggles.
- Remaining advanced UI parity is full Excel PivotChart Tools layout/design editing beyond chart-type changes and deeper per-element PivotStyle gallery theme semantics.

### 7B: Slicer and Timeline UI

Slicer and timeline metadata plus the worksheet-range PivotTable interaction layer are implemented:

- Slicer/timeline metadata loads/saves, cache relationships round-trip, and native package parts are retained where possible.
- Authored slicer/timeline state round-trips, pane controls filter connected PivotTables, and Insert Slicer/Insert Timeline commands are exposed from the contextual PivotTable ribbon.
- Remaining native-fidelity gap: exact Excel slicer/timeline floating drawing objects and style galleries.

### 7C: Advanced Chart Families

- Stock charts (OHLC/candlestick), radar, surface
- Statistical: histogram, Pareto, box-and-whisker
- Hierarchy: treemap, sunburst
- Modern: waterfall, funnel
- Full chart format pane/dialog UX for all chart families

### 7D: Conditional Formatting and Formatting Polish

- Full icon-set rule support: model, XLSX round-trip, cell rendering, rule-manager UI
- Richer color-scale/data-bar options (midpoint control, axis display, border, fill variants)
- Rule-manager dialog matching Excel's full priority and manage-rules UX

---

## Phase 8: Performance and Scalability (estimated: 1-2 sprints)

### 8A: Multi-threaded Recalculation

- Profile recalculation on large workbooks (50k+ formulas) before committing to threading
- If profiling confirms parallelism as the right fix: thread-safe topological evaluation (partition DAG into independent subgraphs, evaluate in parallel)
- Progress reporting and cancellation for long recalculations
- Result-parity tests against the single-threaded engine

### 8B: Large Workbook XLSX Parse Optimization

- SAX/streaming parse for shared-strings and worksheet XML to avoid full DOM allocation
- Incremental sheet-load: parse only the active sheet on open; load other sheets lazily
- Benchmark open time for a 10 MB+ workbook; publish perf baseline in `docs/PERF_BASELINE.md`

---

## Phase 9: XLSX Corpus Expansion (ongoing)

- Continue expanding beyond the prior 90-row manifest baseline toward 100+ workbooks
- Add public/open-license workbooks covering every feature bucket (charts, CF, pivot, validation, named ranges, shared formulas, etc.)
- Graduate per-workbook smoke tests to per-feature structural comparisons (cell values, styles, chart series counts, CF rules, etc.)
- Track and publish pass/fail rate by feature bucket; target 95% of supported features passing before any public release claim
- Add regression entries for every bug fix involving XLSX round-trip or formula result discrepancy

---

## Explicitly Excluded (won't change unless a design doc is written)

- **VBA / macros / COM add-ins / Office Scripts / Office web add-ins** - runtime not available; unsupported parts are preserved in the XLSX package and disclosed on open
- **Power Query, Power Pivot, OLAP data model, Microsoft linked data types** - requires Microsoft infrastructure; metadata is preserved in the XLSX package
- **Microsoft 365 co-authoring, cloud sharing, presence, Teams integration, version history** - requires Microsoft 365 identity and services
- **Enterprise controls** - sensitivity labels, IRM, digital signatures
- **Cube functions** (CUBEMEMBER, CUBEVALUE, etc.) - require a live SSAS/Power Pivot connection
- **External/live data functions** (WEBSERVICE, RTD) - require external service connectivity or real-time data providers
