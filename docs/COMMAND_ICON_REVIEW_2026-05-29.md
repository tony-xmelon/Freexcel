# Freexcel Command Icon Review

**Date:** 2026-05-29  
**Status:** Proposal for design review, no implementation applied  
**Scope:** Title bar/QAT, ribbon commands, formula bar, sheet tabs, status bar, backstage, and command menus where icon metadata is present.

## Evidence Used

- Current XAML and runtime normalization rules in `MainWindow.xaml`, `MainWindow.Ribbon.cs`, `RibbonIconFactory*`, `RibbonCommandPresentationPlanner*`, `RibbonMenuIconSeeder.cs`, and `BorderMenuIcon.cs`.
- Fresh screenshot tour generated with `FREEXCEL_SS_TOUR=1`.
- Contact sheets:
  - `screenshots/icon-audit/ribbon-max-contact.png`
  - `screenshots/icon-audit/ribbon-1100-contact.png`
  - `screenshots/icon-audit/ribbon-900-contact.png`
  - `screenshots/icon-audit/ribbon-750-contact.png`
- Structured inventory from `local:RibbonTooltip.Title` found 363 command titles:
  - Title/QAT: 3
  - Ribbon: 332
  - Formula bar: 2
  - Panes: 2
  - Sheet tabs: 3
  - Status bar: 2
  - Backstage/overlay: 19
- SVG asset inventory: 228 command SVG files, but only 9 small-specific variants. About 193 ribbon command titles currently resolve to fallback or generic art; many of these are hidden/contextual chart or PivotTable commands, but several visible commands are affected.

## Current Size System

The current runtime system is internally consistent enough to keep as the baseline.

| Surface | Current size | Review |
|---|---:|---|
| Title/QAT | 16 px icon in 26x22 button | Good. Readable and aligned with the title bar. |
| Window system buttons | 18 px icon in wide caption hit target | Good after the green-hover pass. |
| Large ribbon commands | 32 px artwork in 34 px slot, 76 px button height | Good. The older 40 px proposal would require a taller ribbon and is not recommended for this pass. |
| Medium/small ribbon commands | 22 px artwork in 24 px slot | Good. Needs more dedicated small SVGs for dense icons. |
| Home icon-only commands | 22 px artwork in 24 px visual cell | Good, but typographic icons need baseline audit. |
| Menu icons | 18 px | Good. Border menu icons are clear at 18 px. |
| Formula/sheet/status small controls | 18-22 px text/custom glyphs | Mostly good after the zoom alignment fix. |

**Decision proposal:** keep the 16 / 18 / 22 / 32 px size system and update older design docs to match it, unless we intentionally redesign the ribbon height.

## Global Proposals

| ID | Proposal | Reason | Priority | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Keep large ribbon artwork at 32 px and small artwork at 22 px. | The rendered screenshots look balanced; 40 px large icons would make the ribbon heavier. | P1 |  |
| G2 | Add small-specific SVG variants for dense icons rendered at 22 px, not only alignment icons. | Current base SVGs often scale down acceptably, but text-heavy icons become fuzzy or crowded. | P1 |  |
| G3 | Replace visible fallback/generic mappings with dedicated assets before doing decorative polish. | The biggest readability problems are wrong semantics, not raw size. | P1 |  |
| G4 | Standardize disabled command treatment: same icon geometry at 38-45% opacity, never blank strips. | Help and add-in disabled commands currently show either overly strong fallback art or nearly blank icon columns. | P1 |  |
| G5 | Add a generated icon review sheet for 16, 18, 22, and 32 px render sizes. | This gives repeatable visual QA for future icon work. | P2 |  |
| G6 | Add a source test that visible ribbon commands do not resolve to `Generic` unless explicitly allow-listed. | Prevents later commands from silently falling back to generic art. | P2 |  |

## Command-by-Command Improvement Proposals

### Title, QAT, Status, Sheet Tabs

| Command | Current | Proposal | Priority | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Save | 16 px white line icon, good. | Keep. Optional future step: use the same SVG source as ribbon Save with white recolor. | P3 |  |
| Undo | 16 px white line icon, good. | Keep. | P3 |  |
| Redo | 16 px white line icon, good. | Keep. | P3 |  |
| Minimize / Maximize / Restore / Close | 18 px white system icons, good. | Keep. | P3 |  |
| Scroll Tabs Left | Text `<` glyph in 27 px hit area. | Keep current simple glyph; optional future SVG only if sheet-tab buttons get icon assets. | P3 |  |
| Insert Sheet | Text `+` in custom tab shape. | Keep current custom shape; do not replace with asset icon. | P3 |  |
| Scroll Tabs Right | Text `>` glyph in 27 px hit area. | Keep current simple glyph. | P3 |  |
| Zoom Out | 18 px text glyph aligned to slider rail. | Keep after current alignment fix. | P3 |  |
| Zoom In | 18 px text glyph aligned to slider rail. | Keep after current alignment fix. | P3 |  |

## Contextual and Hidden Command Families

The inventory contains many hidden/contextual commands that do not appear in the default screenshots. They should be fixed by family rather than one-off art.

| Family | Commands | Proposal | Priority | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chart type commands | Column, Stacked Column, 100% Column, Bar, Stacked Bar, 100% Bar, Line, 3D Line, Area, 3D Area, Stock, Pie, 3D Pie, Doughnut, Scatter, Bubble, Radar, Surface, Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, Pareto, Box and Whisker, Waterfall, Funnel, Map, 3D Column, 3D Bar | Map every chart type to one of the existing chart family assets, then add missing family assets for histogram/treemap/waterfall/funnel/map if those commands become visible. | P2 |  |
| Chart formatting commands | Axis bounds, labels, ticks, gridlines, legend, trendline, data labels, series, plot area, chart title, secondary axis | Reuse a small family of chart-format overlay icons rather than unique art for each option. | P2 |  |
| PivotTable Analyze commands | PivotTable Name, Options, Refresh, Change Data Source, Field Settings, Field List, Group Field, Select, Move PivotTable, Calculated Field/Item, PivotChart, Chart Options | Reuse PivotTable base plus overlay: gear, refresh, source arrow, field list, group, calculator, chart. | P2 |  |
| PivotTable Design commands | Grand Totals, Subtotals, Report Layout, Blank Rows, Banded Rows/Columns, Row/Column Headers, PivotTable Styles | Use table-layout base icons with row/column highlight overlays. | P2 |  |
| Menu-only paste commands | Paste, Values, Formulas, Formatting, Transpose, Paste Special | Existing menu seeding is acceptable; ensure all remain 18 px and share the same visual weight. | P3 |  |
| Border menu commands | All, Outside, Inside, None, Bottom, Top, Left, Right, thick/double variants, line color, line style, More Borders | Existing `BorderMenuIcon` is good at 18 px. Keep. | P3 |  |
| Sheet context menu commands | Rename, Insert Sheet, Duplicate, Delete Sheet, Hide, Unhide, Tab Color, Select All Sheets, Ungroup, Move Left/Right | Add icons only if context menus move to full iconized menus; current text-only menu is acceptable. | P3 |  |

## Proposed Implementation Order

1. **P1 semantic fixes:** Add or remap assets for Add-ins, Data Types, Draw tool family, Page Layout Orientation, Trace Precedents/Dependents, Macros, Contact Support, What's New, and Insert Comments width/truncation.
2. **P2 small readability:** Add small-specific assets for decimal places, formula category icons, Define Name/Use in Formula/Create from Selection, Hide/Unhide, Scale, 100%, Data Validation/Fill accent containment.
3. **P2 guardrails:** Add tests for visible command icon fallback allow-list and disabled icon nonblank rendering.
4. **P3 polish:** Optional iconization for backstage nav and pane close buttons.

## Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Accept current 16 / 18 / 22 / 32 px size system.
- [ ] Accept P1 semantic fixes.
- [ ] Accept P2 small-specific SVG pass.
