# FreeX Command Icon Audit

**Date:** 2026-05-30
**Branch:** `codex/icon-audit-20260530`
**Status:** Reviewable proposal only. No icon or UI implementation changes are included in this branch.

## Scope

This audit covers command icons and command-like icon controls in:

- title bar and quick access commands
- ribbon tabs, contextual PivotTable tabs, ribbon dropdown menus, and collapsed ribbon menus
- backstage navigation, recent/pinned file controls, and backstage context menus
- worksheet, sheet tab, PivotTable field, AutoFilter, and Quick Analysis context menus
- formula bar, sheet tab navigation, horizontal/zoom/status controls
- dialog action clusters where icons would be meaningful
- the SVG command asset library in `src/FreeX.App.Host/Resources/CommandIconsSvg`

Primary source files reviewed:

- `src/FreeX.App.Host/MainWindow.xaml`
- `src/FreeX.App.Host/MainWindow.Ribbon.cs`

## Review Legend

Use the empty columns in each table as the review control.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Accept | Implement the recommendation as proposed. |
| Decline | Keep the current icon behavior. |
| Comment | Reviewer note, variant request, or exception. |

Priority:

- `P0`: consistency rule or source-of-truth fix that affects many commands
- `P1`: visible command is misleading, generic, or stylistically inconsistent
- `P2`: visible command is understandable but should be refined
- `P3`: keep as-is, with optional future cleanup

## Baseline Findings

### Size System

The current runtime size system is usable and should remain the baseline unless we deliberately redesign the ribbon height.

| Surface | Current observed sizes | Assessment | Action |
|---|---:|---|---|
| App icon | `.ico` application icon | Not audited as brand art in this pass. | Keep for now; run a separate brand icon review later. |
| Title/QAT | 16 px icons in compact buttons | Good. | Keep 16 px. |
| Window system buttons | 18 px glyphs | Good. | Keep 18 px. |
| Large ribbon commands | 32 px artwork in 34 px slot | Good Excel-like weight. | Keep 32 px. |
| Small/medium ribbon commands | 22 px artwork in 24 px slot | Good target, but needs more small-specific SVGs. | Keep 22 px. |
| Menu icons | 18 px | Good. | Keep 18 px. |
| Backstage navigation | 15 px white icons | Slightly small, but acceptable. | Keep 15 or move to 16 px consistently. |
| Recent pin buttons | 12 px | Too small compared with backstage rows. | Increase to 14-16 px if row height allows. |
| Formula/status/sheet controls | text glyphs, 18-22 px | Mostly appropriate for chrome controls. | Keep custom chrome glyphs; do not force SVG. |
| Dialog buttons | usually no icon | Correct for OK/Cancel-style modal actions. | Add icons only to toolbar-like action clusters. |

### SVG Asset Health

Inventory of `Resources/CommandIconsSvg`:

- 246 SVG files
- 237 base icon names
- 9 small-specific variants
- 0 large-specific variants
- viewBox mix:
  - 119 icons use `0 0 54 54`
  - 112 icons use `0 0 32 32`
  - 9 icons use `0 0 22 22`
  - 6 icons use `0 0 20 20`
- frequent baked colors:
  - `#242424`, `#202124`, `#FFFFFF`
  - `#0F6D8C`, `#0078D4`, `#E6F6FA`, `#DCECFF`
  - `#FFB900`, `#D32F2F`, `#F7630C`, `#8B5CF6`

Assessment:

- The library is broad, but artboards and stroke weights are mixed. This is visible when 54 px assets are scaled into 22 px ribbon slots.
- Only alignment icons have dedicated small variants. Dense formula, data, draw, and chart-detail icons need small variants first.
- Some command names have exact SVG assets, but backstage white icons bypass SVG loading and use fallback drawings because `CreateStaticRibbonCommandIcon` switches to fallback when the source brush is white.
- Many visible commands are good, but broad planner fallbacks still produce semantically vague icons for command families such as chart detail commands, PivotTable tools, Draw tools, and several backstage entries.

### Excel/Fluent Comparison

Excel generally uses:

- direct command metaphors, not generic "category" metaphors, for visible ribbon commands
- stable command families, e.g. clipboard, font, alignment, number, formula auditing, sort/filter, page setup, view/window
- compact icons with strong silhouettes at small sizes
- limited semantic color, with color used to clarify command type or data category rather than decorate every icon
- text-only modal OK/Cancel buttons, while icon treatment is reserved for ribbon, menu, pane, and toolbar commands

FreeX is closest to Excel where it has exact SVGs and weakest where it uses generic fallback icons, bare text glyphs, or white fallback drawings.

## Global Recommendations

| ID | Recommendation | Assessment | Priority | Accept | Decline | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Keep the 16 / 18 / 22 / 32 px size system. | Balanced with the current ribbon density and Excel-like command proportions. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G2 | Make SVG assets the source of truth on all command surfaces, including white backstage/title icons. | Current white icon path ignores exact SVG assets for commands such as Open, Save As, Export, Home, and Options. | P0 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G3 | Normalize future SVG authoring to one canonical artboard plus explicit small variants. | Mixed 54/32/22/20 viewBoxes make stroke weight unpredictable at 22 px. | P1 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G4 | Add small-specific SVGs for dense 22 px commands beyond alignment. | Formula, chart, data, and draw icons lose clarity when scaled down. | P1 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G5 | Replace visible planner/generic fallbacks before decorative polish. | Wrong metaphor is a bigger problem than slight style mismatch. | P1 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G6 | Keep OK/Cancel/Apply dialog buttons text-only. | Matches Windows and Excel modal behavior. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G7 | Add icons to dialog toolbar/action clusters only. | Sort, Error Checking, Watch Window, Select Data Source, and Accessibility actions behave like command toolbars. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G8 | Add a generated icon contact sheet at 15, 16, 18, 22, and 32 px. | Makes future visual QA repeatable. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G9 | Add a source check that visible ribbon commands do not resolve to `Generic` unless allow-listed. | Prevents silent regressions as commands are added. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| G10 | Reduce baked accent color where a command also receives an accent slot. | Double color treatment is heavier than Excel's current command style. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |

### Context Menus

| Surface | Commands | Current icon behavior | Assessment | Recommendation | Priority | Accept | Decline | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ribbon dropdown menus | Paste variants, borders, orientation, conditional formatting, cell styles, cells, fill/clear/sort/find, chart menus, page layout menus, formulas menus, data menus, view menus | `RibbonMenuIconSeeder` seeds 18 px icons, and border menu uses `BorderMenuIcon`. | Good system. Some fallback mappings are too generic. | Keep 18 px menu icons; add allow-list so section headers remain iconless and visible actions avoid Generic. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Worksheet context menu | Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste Special, Insert, Delete, Sort, Filter, Quick Analysis, Define Name, tables, data tools, comments/notes, Format Cells, Clear commands, hyperlinks | auto seeded 18 px icons by menu header | Good Excel-like direction; several actions need exact icons. | Add exact/alias icons for Quick Analysis, Insert Copied Cells, Pick From Drop-down List, Reapply Filter, Resolve/Unresolve Comment, Row/Column sizing. | P1 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Row/column selection menus | Cut, Copy, Paste, Insert/Delete row/column, Group/Ungroup, Format Cells, Clear Contents | auto seeded 18 px | Good. | Keep; add row/column-specific insert/delete assets if menus feel generic. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Drawing/object context menus | Format Picture/Object, Crop, Reset Crop, Size and Properties, Rotate, Shape Fill/Outline, Alt Text, Selection Pane, Bring Forward, Send Backward | auto seeded 18 px | Mostly good, but generic for object-specific commands. | Add shape/object variants for format, size, rotate, fill, outline. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Sheet tab context menu | Rename, Insert Sheet, Duplicate, Delete Sheet, Hide, Unhide, Tab Color, Select All Sheets, Ungroup Sheets, Move Left, Move Right | auto seeded 18 px where resolved | Good and Excel-like. | Ensure exact `tab-color.svg`, `select-all-sheets.svg`, `ungroup-sheets.svg`, `move-left.svg`, `move-right.svg` are used. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Pivot field context menus | Sort A to Z, Sort Z to A, Select Items, Label Filter, Value Filter, Clear Filter, Value Field Settings | auto seeded 18 px | Good core set, but Select/Value settings are generic. | Add field-specific select/settings icons if menu is frequent. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| AutoFilter menus | Sort, clear filter, text/number/date filters, select all, clear all, color choices | mostly text buttons and submenus | Excel-like; not every button needs an icon. | Add icons only to Sort/Clear/Filter-family buttons; keep color swatches as visual control. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Quick Analysis menu | preview icons from `QuickAnalysisPreviewIconFactory` | Good because previews describe the action better than generic icons. | Keep. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |

### Dialogs

Dialog OK/Cancel/Apply buttons should generally remain text-only. The following dialog action clusters should be audited for optional icons because they behave like command toolbars or side actions.

| Dialog or cluster | Commands | Current icon behavior | Assessment | Recommendation | Priority | Accept | Decline | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sort dialog | Add Level, Delete Level, Copy Level, Move Up, Move Down, Options | text buttons | Toolbar-like cluster; icons would improve scanability. | Add 16 px plus/delete/copy/up/down/options icons beside text. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Error Checking dialog | Help on this error, Show Calculation Steps, Ignore Error, Edit Formula, Go To, Previous, Next, Trace Error | text buttons | Side action stack is command-heavy. | Add 16 px help, trace, ignore, edit, go-to, previous/next icons. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Watch Window / Add Watch | Add Watch, Delete Watch, Go To, Close | mostly text | Command-like window. | Add watch plus/delete/go-to icons. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Select Data Source dialog | Add/Edit/Remove series, Move Up/Down, switch rows/columns | text buttons | Toolbar-like and Excel-like candidate. | Add series plus/edit/delete/up/down/switch icons. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Accessibility Checker | Go To, Close | text buttons | Go To is command-like. | Add small go-to icon to Go To; keep Close text-only. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Allow Edit Range dialog | Delete, Clear All, range picker | text buttons | Delete/Clear are command-like. | Add delete/clear/range-picker icons if visual density allows. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Spell Check dialog | Ignore Once, Ignore All, Change, Change All, Add to Dictionary, Cancel | text buttons | Excel keeps many spelling actions text-first. | Keep text-only unless dialog gets a toolbar treatment. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| AutoFilter dialog | Clear Filter, Text/Number/Date Filters, Select All, Clear All, OK/Cancel | mostly text | Functional and Excel-like. | Add only sort/filter/clear icons if a broader dialog icon pass happens. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Format Cells dialog | font/fill/border color pickers, border preset buttons | swatches and previews | Swatches/previews are better than icons. | Keep visual controls; do not add generic icons. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Page Setup / Header Footer dialogs | range pickers, picture format, print options | text/buttons | Icons only useful for range picker and picture format. | Keep modal actions text-only; add 16 px picker icons consistently if missing. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Print Preview | print/navigation/settings controls | command toolbar behavior | Icons expected. | Audit separately with rendered print preview screenshot. | P2 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Color/theme/palette dialogs | color swatches, customize actions | swatches | Swatches carry meaning. | Keep icons minimal. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Chart formatting dialogs | color pickers, axis/series options | text + swatches | Icons are optional; chart preview matters more. | Add icons only to repeated picker/preview commands. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Data Validation, Text to Columns, Pivot dialogs, Scenario, Consolidate, Remove Duplicates, Subtotal | OK/Cancel plus field actions | text-first dialogs | Text-only matches Excel modal style. | Keep; add picker icons where a range-selector button appears. | P3 | [ ] | [ ] |  |

## Implementation Order Proposal

| Step | Work | Rationale | Accept | Decline | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fix SVG recolor/use path for white backstage/title icons. | High leverage, low visible risk, immediately corrects semantic mismatches. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| 2 | Replace the legacy 10/11 px Home icons with shared 22 px command content. | Visible polish, biggest size inconsistency. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| 3 | Add exact aliases/assets for high-priority visible fallbacks. | Makes ribbon more Excel-like without redesigning layout. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| 4 | Add small variants for dense 22 px icons. | Improves readability at normal and scaled DPI. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| 5 | Add context-menu Generic fallback checks and allow-list. | Prevents noisy or wrong menu icons. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| 6 | Add optional dialog action-cluster icons. | Lower risk after the main command language is stable. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| 7 | Generate visual contact sheets and screenshot verification fixtures. | Gives a repeatable acceptance workflow. | [ ] | [ ] |  |

## Open Questions

| Question | Recommendation | Accept | Decline | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Should disabled/deferred commands show full icons at reduced opacity? | Yes. Keep the same icon geometry at 38-45% opacity. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Should every menu item receive an icon? | No. Action items yes, section headers and purely textual presets no. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Should chart-detail commands each receive unique icons? | Only if visible in normal ribbon states; otherwise use a small modifier family. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Should modal OK/Cancel buttons have icons? | No. Text-only is clearer and closer to Windows/Excel conventions. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
| Should the app icon/brand mark be redesigned in this pass? | No. Treat app branding separately from command iconography. | [ ] | [ ] |  |
