Report scope: missing May 29 project-status snapshot, reconstructed from the integrated `main` history and current planning documents
Mainline observed: branch-neutral `origin/main` snapshot; worker-specific branch and worktree names are intentionally omitted from this status report

## Executive Summary

FreeX entered May 29 as a late-stage parity-hardening build and finished the day with the production-readiness pass integrated. Core product surfaces remain broad and functional: formula coverage is **345/345 in-scope functions**, command coverage is **100% for in-scope commands**, shortcut parity is **100% (87/87)**, and XLSX work is focused on deeper corpus proof and package-retention validation rather than first-pass support.

Overall completion estimate is now **95%**. The remaining work is package-preserving XLSX save validation, broader corpus fidelity proof, live accessibility/release trust validation, and a small set of visual/keytip polish items.

The project history metrics report now covers Git and provider-log activity from 2026-05-12 through 2026-05-29 inclusive. Through May 29, the Git churn table records **10,982 commits**, **13,386 distinct changed files**, **+1,317,530 / -899,900 LoC**, and local provider logs attribute **92,932,144,336 observed raw tokens** across OpenAI/Codex and Anthropic/Claude rows.

## Current Repository Metrics

| Metric | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Tracked files | 2,033 |
| C# source files under `src/` | 967 |
| C# test files under `tests/` | 471 |
| Markdown docs under `docs/` | 238 |
| XLSX corpus manifest rows | 175 |

## Current Repository State

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Mainline | Current status is anchored to `origin/main`; local session branches and checkouts are treated as worker-owned implementation detail |
| Completion tracking | [release/progress.json](../release/progress.json) is updated to `overallCompletion: 95`, mapping tester builds to the `v0.8.<run>` stream |
| History metrics | [PROJECT_BUILD_HISTORY_METRICS.md](PROJECT_BUILD_HISTORY_METRICS.md) is refreshed through 2026-05-29 inclusive |
| Branch posture | Parallel feature branches were active through the day; verified slices were merged frequently into main |
| Release posture | Tester-release automation can produce unsigned local packages; signing, installer trust validation, and human live validation remain open |
| Documentation posture | Current docs point at the source-of-truth backlog, parity matrices, release checklist, and build-history metrics |

## Current Parity Snapshot

| Surface | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Formula engine | 345/345 in-scope functions implemented and tested; May 29 work added edge-case hardening for text, date/time, engineering, trig, statistical, and aggregate functions. |
| Command surface | 100% of in-scope commands covered; May 29 added more command-surface guards, label alignment, and ribbon/menu actionability checks. |
| Keyboard shortcuts | **100% parity** (87/87), **0% partial** (0/87), **0 missing**. |
| XLSX fidelity | 71 in-scope feature categories with support; 175 workbook manifest rows; May 29 added native JSON/XML, SpreadsheetML, XSLT, conditional-format, data-validation, and package-warning hardening. |
| UI/dialog parity | Dialog message routing, access keys, default/cancel semantics, UIA metadata, keytips, ribbon layout, and sheet-tab chrome received broad hardening. |
| Release readiness | User guide and troubleshooting docs are present; unsigned MSIX workflow exists; remaining work is signing/trust validation and live human validation. |

## May 29 Highlights

1. **Production-readiness pass integrated**
   - Accessibility gate, XLSX corpus expansion, dialog parity, shortcut parity, and completion-stream documentation landed through the production-readiness PR batch.

2. **Rebrand foundation completed**
   - The codebase and repository-facing documentation moved to FreeX naming, with current origin pointing at the FreeX repository.

3. **Formula and data fidelity hardening continued**
   - The day included targeted Excel-parity fixes for date/time functions, text functions, engineering functions, statistical edge cases, aggregate coercion, and dynamic-array/structured-reference behavior.

4. **Ribbon, keytip, and command-surface polish advanced**
   - Work covered ribbon adaptive layout stability, nested keytip routing, menu keytip normalization, command-label alignment, and command-surface guard tests across tabs and menus.

5. **Release/test infrastructure tightened**
   - Tester-release preflights, checksum readiness, generated-doc checks, repository preflight wrappers, build-verification documentation, and screenshot-harness checks were strengthened.

## Active Workstream Picture

Parallel implementation remained active by design. The highest-volume areas on May 29 were ribbon/keytip behavior, formula parity, native JSON/XML and SpreadsheetML preservation, command/menu parity, dialog accessibility metadata, tester-release hardening, and performance refactors.

Operational risk remains mostly coordination:

- Keep session branches synced from `main` before editing shared files.
- Merge small verified slices frequently.
- Treat dirty session-owned checkouts as active implementation work.
- Keep docs, [release/progress.json](../release/progress.json), and tester-release naming aligned whenever the completion band changes.
- Keep the build-history token table bounded to completed local-date windows; this report intentionally summarizes through 2026-05-29 inclusive.

## Remaining Outstanding Work

See [OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md](OUTSTANDING_BUILD.md) for the source-of-truth backlog. Key open items:

1. **XLSX corpus and fidelity proof** - Expand the 175-row corpus baseline with more regression workbooks and publish per-feature pass/fail rate.
2. **Package-preserving XLSX save path**
3. **Release documentation and packaging**
4. **Keytip overlay placement**
5. **XLSX warning coverage as new gaps are found**

Product parity remaining is tracked in [NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md](NEXT_PHASES_PLAN.md), including Phase 7D: Deeper color-scale XLSX edge semantics as new gaps are found.
