# Freexcel Project Status Report

Generated: 2026-05-24  
Branch: `main`

## Executive Summary

Freexcel is in deep-polish hardening. All major feature workstreams have reached their first-pass completion targets: formula engine at **345/345 in-scope functions (100%)**, command surface at **100% of in-scope commands** (182 total: 158 fully Implemented + 24 Partial, 0 Not Implemented), keyboard shortcuts at **83% parity** (69/83 in-scope), and XLSX fidelity at **71 in-scope feature categories** with at least partial support. Test count has grown from ~4,902 to **6,454 passing (0 failing)** since the last report.

The remaining work is deepening and hardening existing features, not building new ones. No workstream has a zero-coverage gap. Estimated overall completion: **91%**.

## Work Completed Since 2026-05-21

### Chart dialog polish
- Chart Series, Area, Axis, Error Bars, Data Labels, Trendline, and Trendline options dialogs now focus the relevant control on open, matching Excel's dialog UX.

### PDF export improvements
- Selectable PDF text overlay (searchable/copyable text on top of raster pages).
- PDF initial-view publish options (open-mode, viewer preferences).
- Expanded PDF bookmark modes (sheet names, print-title summaries, page numbers with page-range filtering, outline-viewer mode hints).

### XLSX metadata retention
- Preserve PivotTable drill-enable metadata.
- Preserve PivotTable caption metadata.
- Preserve PivotChart source format ID.
- Preserve chart series invert-if-negative metadata.
- Preserve chart series lines metadata.

### Ribbon polish
- Dropdown menu icons added throughout the ribbon.
- Draw tab ink conversion ribbon placeholders added.
- Ribbon group collapse rules now match exact group labels.
- Home tab font-color ribbon order aligned to Excel.
- Formulas tab defined-names ribbon order aligned to Excel.
- PivotTable Analyze key tip conflicts fixed (Select → SE, PivotChart → PC).

### Performance
- Streaming CSV/cell scan paths to reduce allocation on large sheets.
- Streaming native JSON cell save.
- Delimited text decode optimized.

### Stability
- Initial user-testing bugs fixed.
- Invalid zoom input warning added.

## Parity Completion by Workstream

### Formula Engine — 100% ✓

**345/345 in-scope functions implemented.** All categories complete: Math/Trig (50), Statistical (83), Logical (11), Lookup/Reference (36), Text (33), Date/Time (25), Financial (53), Information (15), Lambda/Advanced (8), Database (12), Engineering/Bit (19). Formula work is now hardening and edge-case coverage, not function addition.

**Remaining gap:** None. Scalar coercion, spill semantics, Unicode text, and XLSX cached-value fixtures are ongoing hardening targets.

---

### Command Surface — 100% of in-scope (24 Partial depth gaps)

**158 Implemented + 24 Partial = 100% coverage (0 Not Implemented).** Every in-scope Excel command has at least a working implementation. Partial items represent depth/polish within existing features.

Key Partial depth gaps by tab:

| Area | Gap |
|---|---|
| Conditional Formatting (Home) | Simplified rule manager — full priority ordering and duplicate/range-edit parity |
| Icon Sets (Home CF) | Authoring/editing UI; rendering is implemented |
| Format as Table / Cell Styles | Full table style theme semantics (color resolution, effect layers) |
| Custom Number Format | Exact accounting layout widths; OS-localized special date/time patterns |
| Flash Fill | Excel's ML-level inference (deterministic common-pattern inference is implemented) |
| PDF Export (File) | Full vector PDF graphics; remaining publish option matrix |
| Theme System (Page Layout) | Deep OOXML effect layers beyond color/font presets |
| Interactive Object Handles (Draw) | Drag-resize/move handles; command-based size/rotation is implemented |
| Full Gradient Gallery (Draw) | Two-color gradient + shadow implemented; additional effect types pending |
| Error Checking (Formulas) | Partial rule taxonomy; core checks (blank refs, inconsistent formulas, etc.) implemented |
| PivotTable (Insert) | Exact full-gallery PivotStyle theme semantics; merged-label edge cases |
| Comment/Note (Insert/Review) | Full threaded conversation/reply UI; single-message create/edit/delete is implemented |
| Border Gallery (Home) | Interactive draw/erase border tools; preset gallery with remembered color/style is implemented |
| Full Locale Accounting (Home) | Exact accounting layout widths; modeled LCID catalog is broad but not exhaustive |

**Deferred (2):** Advanced chart families (treemap/waterfall/sunburst/histogram/box-whisker/funnel/map); multi-window view (New Window, Side-by-Side).

### Keyboard Shortcuts — 83% parity

**69/83 in-scope shortcuts at full parity. 14 Partial. 0 Not Implemented.**

| Status | Count | % |
|---|---:|---:|
| Parity | 69 | 83% |
| Partial | 14 | 17% |
| Not Implemented | 0 | 0% |

Partial shortcuts and their gaps:

| Shortcut | What's implemented | What's missing |
|---|---|---|
| Ctrl+P | Routes through File/Print → print preview with native print dialog | Full Excel print backstage/settings editing |
| Ctrl+V / Ctrl+Alt+V | Values, formulas, formats, transpose, arithmetic, link, picture, column-widths, comments, validation, number-format, skip-blanks paths | Remaining Excel paste/Paste Special option matrix |
| Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+Shift+F,P | Full Number/Alignment/Font/Fill/Border/Protection model | Broader Excel multi-page dialog surface |
| Alt+Down | Excel-style AutoFilter menu with two-condition custom criteria | Richer nested filter command UI |
| Ctrl+Q | Quick Analysis with command-backed live preview, all major chart/format/totals/sparkline families | Full rendered worksheet gallery previews |
| Shift+F2 / Ctrl+Shift+F2 | Note and threaded-comment create/edit workflows | Full threaded conversation/reply/mention UI |
| F10 | Ribbon keytip mode with measured overlay badges | Pixel-perfect Excel overlay placement |
| Tab in ribbon | Explicit focus stops with arrow/Home/End traversal | Full Excel QAT + title bar + overflow choreography |
| Shift+F10 / Menu key | Command-backed worksheet, row/col, and object context menus | Remaining full Excel context menu contents |
| F6 / Shift+F6 | Forward/back shell focus cycle through all panes | Full Excel task pane + collapsed ribbon overflow choreography |
| Alt (keytip mode) | Full ribbon tab/command keytip routing; Conditional Formatting nested keytips | Pixel-perfect overlay placement; additional nested submenu keytips |
| F4 outside editing | Repeats all core formatting, paste, fill, sort/filter, insert/delete, outline, and chart commands | Some dialog-driven workflows intentionally non-repeatable |
| Ctrl+5 | ✓ Parity — strikethrough | — |
| Ctrl+; / Ctrl+Shift+; | ✓ Parity — date/time insertion | — |

### XLSX Fidelity — 71 in-scope feature categories with support

**19 Implemented (full model-authoritative round-trip) + 52 Partial (metadata retained or model partial) + 15 Excluded (retained as opaque package parts).**

The contract is package-preserving best-effort: what Freexcel models is saved authoritatively; native metadata outside the model is retained from the source package.

Key remaining fidelity gaps (Partial that still have visible behavior gaps):

| Feature | Gap |
|---|---|
| Advanced chart families | Surface/3D: modeled and rendered. Histogram/Pareto/waterfall/treemap/sunburst/box-whisker/funnel/map: recognized and blocked from broken rendering; per-family data model + package writer deferred |
| Icon-set conditional formatting | Rendering implemented (3/4/5-band sets, arrows/lights/signs/symbols/flags); full authoring/editing UI and advanced OOXML styles partial |
| PivotTable + PivotChart | Core round-trip solid; full PivotStyle gallery theme semantics (effect layers, color token resolution) partial; OLAP/Data Model excluded |
| Slicer / Timeline | Load/save, state, and connected PivotTable filtering implemented; exact native Excel floating drawing object styling partial |
| Structured Tables | Structured references, filter execution, totals-row, and basic data-body semantics implemented; full table style theme semantics and auto-expand partial |
| Threaded comments | XLSX package retention only; in-app threaded comment model uses a simplified create/edit/delete single-message workflow |
| External workbook links | Load/save metadata; formula resolution across external workbooks deferred |
| Chart formatting | Per-series rich format dialogs baseline; full format pane surface (advanced fill/outline/effects/shadows) partial |
| Theme deep effects | Color/font preset resolution works; OOXML gradient/shadow/glow/reflection effect layers deferred |

## What Remains to Reach Full Parity (Within Scope)

Ranked by impact on user-visible fidelity:

### High impact

1. **Full CF rule manager** — Priority reordering, rule duplication, range editing, and icon-set authoring to match Excel's Manage Rules dialog. The rendering and XLSX round-trip are complete; the manager UI is simplified.

2. **Full threaded comment UI** — Multi-message thread, reply, @mention, resolve/reopen. The single-message workflow is implemented; Excel's conversation-thread UX is not.

3. **Interactive object drag handles** — Click-to-select + drag-resize/move for pictures, shapes, and text boxes. Command-based size/rotation is implemented; mouse-drag adorner layer is not.

4. **Advanced chart families rendering** — Histogram, Pareto, treemap, sunburst, waterfall, funnel, box-and-whisker, map. Each needs a data model and WPF renderer; surface/3D has a path but limited rendering.

5. **Full print backstage** — Ctrl+P currently routes to a simplified print preview. Full Excel-style print settings editing (margins, scaling, page range, per-sheet collation) is missing.

### Medium impact

6. **Full paste/Paste Special matrix** — The most common paths (values, formulas, formats, arithmetic, transpose, link, picture, column widths, comments, validation) are done. Remaining Excel-specific modes are edge cases.

7. **Pixel-perfect keytip overlay placement** — Keytip routing is functionally complete; overlay badge positions are measured but not pixel-matched to Excel.

8. **Full gradient/effects gallery (Draw)** — Two-color gradient + shadow implemented. Full Excel effect type catalog (glow, reflection, bevel, 3D rotation, etc.) deferred.

9. **Table style theme semantics** — Table banding and style names round-trip; deep color-token resolution against the workbook theme for custom table styles is partial.

10. **Flash Fill ML inference** — Deterministic common-pattern inference is implemented. Excel's full training-data heuristic inference is proprietary.

### Low impact / polish

11. **Full context menu contents** (Shift+F10) — Core commands implemented; some Excel-specific context menu entries absent.

12. **Full ribbon focus choreography** (Tab, F6) — Functional focus cycling implemented; exact Excel QAT + overflow + task pane choreography not complete.

13. **OS-localized special date/time patterns** — Modeled LCID currency/separator catalog is broad; OS-localized long-date/time patterns and exact accounting widths partially resolved.

14. **Interactive crop handles** — Crop command is undoable and persisted; drag-handle crop UI deferred.

15. **XLSX corpus expansion** — Current 90-row manifest covers common feature combinations. Growing to 100+ public workbooks and graduating per-feature structural comparisons to per-test baselines.
