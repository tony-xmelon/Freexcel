# FreeX UI Test Catalog

Canonical path: `docs/UI_TEST_CATALOG.md`
Baseline source: synced from latest `origin/main` before each catalog update.

## Purpose

This is the comprehensive and append-only UI test catalog for FreeX. It translates the command parity, shortcut parity, and WPF surface into an execution plan for mouse, keyboard, keytip, context-menu, dialog, and UI Automation testing, and it is also the single chronological place to record coverage status, findings, smoke checks, blocked attempts, and session notes.

Do not append new UI testing work to a separate coverage log. Every pass should update this catalog with which rows were exercised, what target was used, which command was expected, and which model/UI state proved the action worked.

## Coverage Contract

Every supported command should eventually have evidence for each applicable layer:

| Layer | Required proof |
|---|---|
| Visible surface | Button/menu/control is visible in the correct ribbon, backstage page, dialog, context menu, status bar, or grid state. |
| Mouse activation | Click, double-click, drag, wheel, resize, or menu selection triggers the expected command path. |
| Keyboard activation | Shortcut, access key, keytip sequence, tab traversal, Enter/Space, Escape, and accelerator behavior trigger or cancel correctly. |
| Command routing | The UI path reaches the intended host handler and command bus/model command where one exists. |
| State mutation | Workbook, sheet, selection, style, drawing, chart, pivot, table, view, file, or dialog state changes exactly as expected. |
| Undo/repeat | Undo/redo and F4 repeat are verified for commands that are meant to be undoable or repeatable. |
| Target breadth | The command is tested against every supported target class listed in the target matrix below. |
| Accessibility | Automation name/id, Invoke/Toggle/Selection/ExpandCollapse pattern, focus return, and disabled-state behavior are verified where applicable. |
| Persistence | Save/load or export output is checked when the command changes persisted workbook state. |

## Current Verification Baseline

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Git state | `git status --short --branch` | Record the active session branch and leave unrelated modified files untouched. |
| Worktrees | `git worktree list --porcelain` | Current checkout is an active session branch; no nested worktree created. |
| Build | `dotnet build FreeX.slnx -m:1` | Passed, 0 warnings, 0 errors. |
| Rebuild after worktree changed | `dotnet build FreeX.slnx -m:1` | Passed, 0 warnings, 0 errors. |
| Focused finding regression tests | `dotnet test tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests\|FullyQualifiedName~KeyboardShortcutMatcherTests\|FullyQualifiedName~WorksheetContextMenuPlannerTests"` | Passed, 194 tests, 0 failures. |
| UIA dialog entry regression tests | `dotnet test tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests"` | Passed, 68 tests, 0 failures. |
| UIA dialog entry regression recheck | `dotnet test tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests" -m:1 /nodeReuse:false -p:UseSharedCompilation=false` | Passed, 74 tests, 0 failures. |
| Host regression suite | `dotnet test tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests.csproj` | Passed, 847 tests, 0 failures. |
| Current build | `dotnet build FreeX.slnx -m:1` | Passed, 0 warnings, 0 errors. |
| Continuation UIA/mouse dialog pass | Fresh Debug build launched via `src\FreeX.App.Host\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0\FreeX.App.Host.exe`; UIA activation plus guarded mouse clicks where foreground was verified. | Account and About opened by foreground-confirmed mouse clicks. UIA `InvokePattern` still returned success for Insert Function/About without opening a dialog before the fix. |
| Catalog branch build baseline | `dotnet build FreeX.slnx -m:1 /nodeReuse:false -p:UseSharedCompilation=false` | Passed on 2026-05-21 from latest fetched `origin/main`. |

## Coverage Model

Each surface is tracked with these states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Not Started | No current manual pass in this session. |
| In Progress | One or more paths tested, more expected. |
| Passed | Smoke path passed with no issue observed. |
| Finding | One or more issues recorded below. |
| Blocked | Could not test because of environment, missing data, modal/system dependency, focus safety, or crash. |
| Excluded | Intentionally out of scope for FreeX or delegated to operating-system/native UI. |

| View state | normal/page layout/page break, frozen panes, split panes, zoom levels, hidden headings/gridlines/formula bar. |
| Dialog state | default values, changed values, invalid input, OK, Cancel, Escape, access keys, focus order. |

## Interaction Channels

| Channel | Scope |
|---|---|
| Mouse | Ribbon buttons, dropdown arrows, menu items, grid click/drag, fill handle, column/row resize, sheet tabs, status zoom, dialogs, backstage navigation. |
| Keyboard shortcut | All rows in `SHORTCUT_PARITY_MATRIX.md`, with exact-modifier rejection where documented. |
| Ribbon keytips | Alt/F10 top-level badges, tab badges, QAT badges, command badges, dropdown menu keytips, nested Conditional Formatting menu keytips, Escape cancellation. |
| Access keys | Dialog mnemonic labels, menu headers, backstage commands, context menus, OK/Cancel/Apply-style button rows. |
| Context menu | Worksheet right-click, Shift+F10, Menu key, sheet-tab context menu, pivot field context menu, chart/PivotChart field menus, object-aware variants. |
| UI Automation | Stable AutomationId/Name, Invoke/Toggle/Selection/ExpandCollapse patterns, focus movement, top-level owned dialog detection. |
| Direct model verification | Use command bus state, workbook model assertions, saved file inspection, or existing unit tests to confirm non-visual effects. |

## Inspected Surface Inventory

| Surface | Catalog notes |
|---|---|
| Shortcut/keytip routing | 87 documented shortcut rows; 73 matcher rules; 72 dispatcher targets; broad XAML keytip metadata including top-level `F/H/N/J/P/M/A/R/W/Y` plus contextual PivotTable `JA/JD`; representative nested menu keytip coverage exists; all 87 shortcut rows are at Parity. |
| Mouse/grid interaction | Grid click, Shift+click, drag selection, double-click edit/pivot detail, row/column/top-left header selection, autofill handle, row/column resize, page-layout margin guide drag, split divider drag, split-pane mini-scrollbars, pivot chart field buttons, wheel/Shift+wheel/Ctrl+wheel, and sheet-tab click/group/drag/double-click/right-click all need live WPF hit-test evidence. |
| Context menus | Worksheet context menu has 50 planner commands and should be tested through right-click, Shift+F10, Menu key, access-key traversal, target-specific disabled states, and command state mutation. Sheet-tab, pivot field, ribbon dropdown, backstage recent/pinned, and object-aware context menus need separate rows. |
| Ribbon/backstage/dialogs | Backstage, QAT, Home, Insert, Draw, Page Layout, Formulas, Data, Review, View, contextual PivotTable Analyze/Design, and Help are fully inventoried in parity docs. Dialog coverage is strong at parser/planner level but needs real focus order, access keys, Escape/Enter/default/cancel, high-DPI layout, and UIA pattern checks. |
| System-dependent flows | Open/Save file dialogs, picture/background import, CSV Get Data, PDF/XPS export save dialogs, Windows Share, browser Help/Feedback links, and print dialogs require guarded environment-aware manual testing. |

## Live Input Safety Rule

Before any global keyboard or mouse input, verify that the foreground window belongs to the launched FreeX process and that the window title matches the expected workbook. Re-check this before every click, drag, wheel, or key sequence. If any other application owns foreground focus, mark the attempt Blocked and discard any screenshots from that attempt.

UI formula-edit coloring now resolves table column refs, `#Headers`, current-row, `#This Row`, and multi-column ranges through the shared structured-reference resolver while preserving normal grid-reference coloring afterward. Remaining work is live table creation/editing, rendered formula edit coloring, and save/load evidence. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-INSERT-011 | UI-CAT-INSERT-001 | PivotTable style gallery and style options | Deterministic UI/model coverage now guards built-in Light/Medium/Dark style cataloging, custom/current style preservation, lightweight gallery routing, style option button routing, and row/column header plus banded row/column toggles preserving the active style. Remaining work is live activation, explicit rendered style proof for `PivotStyleMedium2`, undo/repeat, and save/load evidence from UI workflows. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-INSERT-012 | UI-CAT-INSERT-001 | PivotTable Show Details drill-down | Core command coverage now verifies detail-sheet creation, affected-cell targeting, extracted source rows, undo removal, disabled-state rejection, workbook-structure protection, and unique detail sheet naming; host planner/source coverage guards ribbon entry point, double-click-before-edit gesture routing, no fallback outside a PivotTable, undoable `DrillDownPivotTableCommand` use, affected-cell detail-sheet activation, tab refresh, and viewport refresh. Remaining work is live item/subtotal/grand-total/matrix/filtered-cell execution, focus proof, and save/load behavior. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-INSERT-013 | UI-CAT-INSERT-001 | Pivot slicer and timeline authoring | Insert slicers/timelines with field selector default focus for connected worksheet-range PivotTables, use pane controls and keyboard selection, verify filter state, clear/filter buttons, cross-sheet source data, cache relationships, persistence, and partial/excluded native floating-object fidelity notes. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-INSERT-014 | UI-CAT-INSERT-001 | PivotChart field buttons and options | Insert bound PivotChart with recommended-gallery default focus, PivotChart options with style-gallery default focus, toggle master/report-filter/axis-field/value-field buttons, open field-button menus, verify sort/filter/value-settings routes, native JSON persistence, binding refresh after PivotTable layout changes, and chart selection focus. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-INSERT-015 | UI-CAT-INSERT-001 | GETPIVOTDATA UI/formula behavior | With PivotTable selection active, create `GETPIVOTDATA` formulas by cell selection and manual edit; verify lookup results, invalid field/item handling, recalculation after pivot filters/layout changes, formula bar display, and save/load. | In Progress - core GETPIVOTDATA evaluation is covered by `PhaseA2FunctionTests`; Insert Function categorizes/searches `GETPIVOTDATA`; formula point-mode cell selection now plans `GETPIVOTDATA(...)` for PivotTable value cells with row, column, page-filter, subtotal, grand-total, cross-sheet quoting, and string-escaping coverage in `GetPivotDataFormulaPlannerTests`. |
| UI-CMD-INSERT-016 | UI-CAT-INSERT-002 | Chart design metadata and Select Data deferred controls | Create chart, change type/style/title/legend/data source through visible dialogs, verify design metadata persisted to native JSON, Select Data helper/deferred controls are labeled honestly, and chart commands enable only for chart targets. | Not Started |
| UI-CMD-PAGE-006 | UI-CAT-PAGE-001 | Page Setup and Header/Footer dialog fidelity | Page Setup has tab/access-key coverage, normal Page Setup orientation default focus, Print Titles Sheet-tab repeat-rows default focus, and Scale to Fit active scaling-input focus; remaining work includes first/odd/even header/footer variants, presets, section fields, token buttons, center on page, page order, OK/Cancel/Escape, print preview reflection, and persistence. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-FORM-006 | UI-CAT-FORMULAS-001 | Insert Function category breadth | Through Insert Function and formula bar, cover recently surfaced function families including dynamic arrays, database, engineering, financial, statistical, lookup/reference, text, date/time, logical, math/trig, higher-order/lambda-adjacent, and pivot functions; verify search, MRU, argument help, invalid arguments, and formula insertion. | In Progress - Insert Function catalog now categorizes representative database, engineering, expanded dynamic-array, higher-order/lambda-adjacent, and PivotTable functions; argument-help metadata covers representative dynamic array, database, engineering, higher-order, and `GETPIVOTDATA` entries through `InsertFunctionDialogTests` and `InsertFunctionCatalogPlannerTests`. |
| UI-CMD-DATA-008 | UI-CAT-DATA-001 | AutoFilter typed criteria and ribbon/keytip routes | AutoFilter dialog now supports the Excel `Alt+Down,F` continuation key by opening the visible text/number/date filter submenu and focusing its first command without hijacking literal `f` typed into search or criteria fields; nested text/number/date filter submenu commands now receive unique scoped access keys, filter-by-color swatches are keyboardable with Tab/Enter/Space plus Arrow/Home/End navigation, the value checklist exposes a named keyboard target with Space toggle plus Home/End boundary navigation, blank filter headers fall back to the absolute worksheet column label, Reapply Filter reruns the remembered AutoFilter command without reopening the dialog, live host coverage proves Reapply refreshes filter-hidden rows after data changes and Clear Filter removes filter-hidden rows after a live filter application, and typed criteria now has dialog-to-filter-command row visibility proof. Remaining work includes full mouse/Alt keytip dropdown creation from headers. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-DATA-009 | UI-CAT-DATA-001 | Advanced Filter dialog safety and criteria defaults | Cover list range, criteria range, copy-to range, unique records, invalid/missing criteria, no-risk defaults, OK/Cancel/Escape, range picker focus, and resulting filtered/copied output. | In Progress - dialog planner rejects missing/unsafe list and criteria ranges before command execution, copy-to controls stay disabled in no-risk in-place mode, criteria defaults remain blank until explicitly supplied, action/range controls have unique access keys, range pickers refocus the requested input, host source coverage proves repeatable `AdvancedFilterCommand` execution plus copy destination focus, and core command tests cover in-place, copy-to, unique, cross-sheet criteria, protected-sheet, invalid-header, undo, and stale-output behavior. |
| UI-CMD-DATA-010 | UI-CAT-DATA-003 | Subtotal dialog Excel-like flow | Cover At each change in, Use function, Add subtotal to, Replace current, Page break, Summary below, Remove All, grouped outline levels, invalid source, access keys, undo, and save/load. | In Progress - dialog coverage proves Excel-like defaults for group column, Sum function, subtotal-column checks, Replace current, Page break, Summary below, OK/Cancel/Remove All buttons, invalid no-column apply, access-keyed/static control order, Remove All routing, Replace-current composite command routing, and option propagation; core command tests cover inserted subtotal/grand-total rows, multiple value columns, page breaks, summary-above/below, invalid source, protected sheets, remove-all undo, and undo restoration. |
| UI-CMD-REVIEW-006 | UI-CAT-REVIEW-002 | Protection permissions and command disabled-state matrix | Protect sheet/workbook with selected permissions, Allow Edit Ranges disabled while the active sheet is protected and blocked from Review keytip invocation, locked/unlocked cells, password/cancel/invalid flows, ribbon/context/menu disabled states, edit attempts by target type, unprotect, undo limits, and persistence. Existing coverage proves selected permission labels map to sheet protection permissions, Allow Edit Ranges is disabled and not keytip-routable while the active sheet is protected, command guards enforce row/column formatting and mutation permissions, and undo restores protection state. Remaining work is broader live UI target-matrix evidence and persistence round trips. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-RIBBON-004 | UI-CAT-SHELL-001 | Ribbon SVG icon visual coverage | Sweep all visible large/small generated icons across File/QAT/ribbon/contextual tabs; verify no missing keys, correct icon-only/icon+label layout, high-DPI scaling, disabled state tint, tooltip/name parity, and no clipping across tabs. Automated coverage now asserts visible main ribbon tooltip titles resolve to semantic icons instead of the generic fallback, and the Data Sort/Filter group uses vector `RibbonIcon` controls instead of text placeholder icons; File/QAT/contextual visual screenshot breadth remains. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-HARNESS-001 | UI-CAT-SHELL-001 | Screenshot and visual evidence harness | Use `tools/screenshot_excel.ps1` and `tools/screenshot_ribbon.ps1` against latest build; verify foreground guard, captured window bounds, ribbon-tab screenshots, popup/dropdown limitations, output naming, and catalog evidence attachment. Source tests now prove both scripts declare the guarded ribbon tab set, capture from window bounds, write deterministic `excel_*/ribbon_*` output names, and emit `screenshot_manifest.json` metadata for catalog evidence plus popup/dropdown limitations. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-CONTEXT-006 | UI-CAT-CONTEXT-001 | Target-specific worksheet context coverage | Planner coverage now verifies worksheet, row, column, picture, shape, and text-box context menus expose only their expected command families. Live Shift+F10/Menu host coverage now proves worksheet, whole-row, whole-column, picture, shape, and text-box scoped routing with target-specific first focus and access headers. Remaining work includes live right-click/Menu routing for table, filtered range, chart, PivotTable, protected sheet, and edit-mode enabled states. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-DIALOG-001 | UI-CAT-SHELL-002 | Dialog keyboard/accessibility sweep | For every modal/modeless dialog reached from command rows, record default focus, Tab order, access-key collisions, Enter/Space/Escape behavior, OK/Cancel equivalence, validation messages, UIA names/patterns, and focus return target; Advanced Filter, Consolidate, Go To Special, Scenario Manager, Subtotal, and Data Table now record default-focus coverage. | In Progress |
| UI-CMD-TARGET-001 | UI-CAT-GRID-001 | Cross-target command matrix execution | Re-run each command class against single cell, multi-cell range, whole row, whole column, non-contiguous selection, table body/header/totals, filtered selection, chart, drawing, PivotTable, protected sheet, hidden row/column, and multi-sheet group targets; record unsupported targets explicitly. | Not Started |

## First-Pass Test Queue

1. Launch latest Debug build and capture process/window state.
2. Exercise File/backstage: create blank workbook, Options, Account, Print/Export messages, return to workbook.
3. Exercise worksheet grid: type values/formulas, edit with F2/formula bar, navigate with Enter/Tab/arrows, undo/redo.
4. Exercise Home ribbon: bold/italic/underline, fill/font color prompts, borders menu, number format, merge, Find/Replace, Format Cells.
5. Exercise keyboard/keytips: Alt/F10 top-level tabs, Home command keytips, Escape, Shift+F10 worksheet menu, Ctrl+1.
6. Exercise sheet tabs/status: add/rename/duplicate/move/color/hide/unhide sheets, zoom controls.
7. Record findings immediately with reproduction, expected behavior, actual behavior, severity, and evidence.

## Execution Waves

| Wave | Goal | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Inventory guard | Keep catalog in sync with code. | Counts for XAML click handlers, shortcuts, context menu commands, command inventory, and docs are updated. |
| 1. Launch/shell/backstage | Prove app starts and global surfaces work. | Latest build launches, shell renders, File/QAT/title/status basics pass by mouse and keyboard. |
| 2. Keyboard/keytips | Prove command access without mouse. | All shortcut matrix rows and top-level/keyed ribbon paths are either passed, partial with finding, or explicitly blocked. |
| 3. Home/grid/core editing | Prove common spreadsheet work. | Cell/range/row/column/sheet targets pass for selection, editing, formatting, clipboard, insert/delete, undo/redo, F4. |
| 4. Ribbon tab sweep | Exercise every visible command by tab. | Every in-scope command row has at least one mouse activation, one keyboard/keytip/access-key path where applicable, and state proof. |
| 5. Contextual/object surfaces | Cover targets that appear only after selection. | PivotTable, chart, drawing, table, slicer/timeline, sparkline, and sheet-tab contextual surfaces are covered. |
| 6. Dialog catalog | Cover every modal/modeless dialog. | Each dialog has default, changed, invalid, OK, Cancel/Escape, access-key, focus-order, and UIA evidence. |
| 7. Persistence/output | Prove command effects survive IO. | Relevant actions are verified through save/load, CSV/XLSX/native JSON, PDF/XPS, print preview, or screenshot evidence. |
| 8. Regression closure | Convert findings into automated guards. | Each fixed bug has a focused unit/source/UIA test and a retest entry in this catalog. |

## Per-Command Record Template

Use this table shape in follow-up passes when recording detailed rows:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Catalog ID | `UI-CAT-AREA-NNN` |
| Command | Visible command name and source doc row. |
| Surfaces | Mouse, shortcut, keytip, access key, context menu, UIA. |
| Targets | Applicable target-matrix entries. |
| Expected command route | Host handler and model command/planner where known. |
| Expected result | State mutation, visual change, dialog, output, or persisted package change. |
| Evidence | Screenshot, test command, model assertion, saved file path, or finding ID. |
| Status | Not Started, In Progress, Passed, Partial, Finding, Blocked, Excluded. |

## Catalog Maintenance Rules

- Keep this file date-free and canonical at `docs/UI_TEST_CATALOG.md`.
- Append new coverage rows, finding IDs, smoke checks, and session notes here only.
- Update the row status in `Catalog Row Index` whenever evidence changes a row from Not Started to In Progress, Passed, Finding, Blocked, or Excluded.
- Preserve historical findings; add retest notes instead of rewriting old observations away.
- After each sync from `main`, refresh inventory counts when command docs or `MainWindow.xaml` changed.

## Findings Log

### UI-2026-05-19-001: File backstage does not close with Escape

Severity: P2
Status: Fixed
Evidence: `docs/ui-test-artifacts/file-backstage.png`, `docs/ui-test-artifacts/backstage-after-second-escape.png`
Fix: `MainWindow` handles bare Escape while Backstage is visible and returns focus to the workbook before normal transient-mode cancellation.
Verification: `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.EscapeFromVisibleBackstage_ReturnsToWorkbookBeforeTransientCancellation`.

Repro:

1. Launch FreeX.
2. Open File backstage with `Alt+F`.
3. Press `Escape`.
4. Press `Escape` again.

Expected: Backstage returns to the workbook, matching the normal keyboard escape route from a temporary full-window command surface.

Actual: The keytip badges clear after the first Escape, but the File backstage remains visible after a second Escape. The only observed visual route back is the back arrow.

### UI-2026-05-19-002: F10 does not visibly enter ribbon keytip mode from the worksheet

Severity: P2
Status: Fixed
Evidence: `docs/ui-test-artifacts/keytips-f10.png`
Fix: `MainWindow` handles `F10` during `PreviewKeyDown`, before worksheet focus can consume it, and enters top-level ribbon keytip mode.
Verification: `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.MainWindowPreviewKeys_HandleWorksheetKeytipAndContextMenuEntryPoints` plus existing shortcut/keytip tests.

Repro:

1. Launch FreeX and keep focus on the worksheet.
2. Press `F10`.

Expected: Ribbon keytip badges appear for the top-level tabs and QAT, as documented in `docs/SHORTCUT_PARITY_MATRIX.md`.

Actual: No keytip badges appeared in the captured worksheet view. `Alt+F` did open File backstage with keytip badges, so the keytip system was present but this entry path needed a focused retest/fix.

### UI-2026-05-19-003: Shift+F10 did not open the worksheet context menu in the initial pass

Severity: P2
Status: Fixed after recheck
Evidence: `docs/ui-test-artifacts/worksheet-context-menu.png`
Fix: `MainWindow` handles `Shift+F10` during `PreviewKeyDown` and routes it through the existing worksheet context menu command path.
Verification: `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.MainWindowPreviewKeys_HandleWorksheetKeytipAndContextMenuEntryPoints`, `KeyboardShortcutMatcherTests`, and `WorksheetContextMenuPlannerTests`.

Repro:

1. Select a worksheet cell.
2. Press `Shift+F10`.

Expected: Worksheet context menu opens from the active cell.

Actual: No context menu appeared in the captured worksheet view. This needed a focused recheck using a verified foreground FreeX window before filing as a product bug.

### UI-2026-05-19-004: Backstage Options is visible but not UI Automation invokable

Severity: P2
Status: Fixed
Evidence: `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass4-file-open.png`, `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass3-after-options.png`
Fix: The Backstage Options command has explicit `x:Name`, `AutomationProperties.Name`, `AutomationProperties.AutomationId`, help text, and tab-stop metadata while retaining the normal button `Click` handler.
Verification: `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.BackstageOptionsEntryPoint_IsNamedCommandForUiAutomation`.

Repro:

1. Launch FreeX.
2. Open File backstage.
3. Inspect or activate the visible `Options` item through UI Automation.

Expected: The visible `Options` command exposes an activation pattern, such as `InvokePattern`, matching its role as a clickable command and supporting accessibility/test automation.

Actual: The visible `Options` element was found by name, but it exposed no Invoke, Select, or ExpandCollapse pattern. A UIA activation attempt failed with `No invoke/select/expand pattern for Options`.

### UI-2026-05-19-005: Backstage Account is visible but not UI Automation invokable

Severity: P2
Status: Fixed
Evidence: `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass7-after-account-attempt.png`, `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass10-account-mouse.png`
Fix: Backstage Account now uses `AutomationInvokeButton` with stable `AutomationProperties.Name`, `AutomationProperties.AutomationId`, help text, tab-stop metadata, and an owned activated message route.
Verification: `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.BackstageAccountEntryPoint_DisclosesLocalAccountDecision` and `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.DialogEntryPointButtons_HaveStableAutomationIds`.

Repro:

1. Launch FreeX.
2. Open File backstage.
3. Inspect or activate the visible `Account` item through UI Automation.

Expected: The visible `Account` command exposes an activation pattern, such as `InvokePattern`, matching its role as a clickable backstage navigation command.

Actual: The visible `Account` element exposed only `SynchronizedInputPattern` and no Invoke, Select, or ExpandCollapse pattern in the UIA pass. A guarded foreground mouse click did open the Account informational dialog, so this was scoped to accessibility/test automation rather than the visual click path.

### UI-2026-05-19-006: UIA Invoke on dialog entry points returns without opening dialogs

Severity: P2
Status: Fixed
Evidence: `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass8-after-fx-invoke.png`, `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass8-after-options-invoke.png`, `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass9-help-tab.png`, `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass11b-insert-function-activation.png`, `docs/ui-test-artifacts/pass11b-about-activation.png`
Fix: Insert Function, About FreeX, Account, and Options now use an explicit `IInvokeProvider` button peer that dispatches the click to the WPF dispatcher; dialog/message entry points are shown as owned, activated windows/messages.
Verification: `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.DialogEntryPointButtons_HaveStableAutomationIds`, `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests.DialogEntryPointHandlers_UseOwnedActivatedDialogs`, and focused `MainWindowXamlKeyTipTests` run passed 74 tests.

Repro:

1. Launch FreeX.
2. Invoke `Insert Function` through UI Automation.
3. Select Help through UI Automation and invoke `About FreeX`.
4. Inspect top-level windows for the FreeX process after each invocation.

Expected: Each dialog entry point opens its corresponding dialog, and the dialog appears as a top-level owned window in the FreeX process.

Actual: `Insert Function` and `About FreeX` both exposed activation patterns and returned from UIA activation, but no additional FreeX top-level dialog appeared. Later mouse checks proved the visual click path worked, while UI Automation activation needed the fix above.

## Passed Smoke Checks

| External paste OS clipboard guard | Automated test | `ClipboardPastePlannerTests.ExternalPaste_UsesRealWindowsClipboardTextAndRejectsStaleInternalCopy` sets the real Windows clipboard on an STA thread, verifies stale internal-copy rejection, and deserializes a 2x2 tab-delimited paste payload. Live Ctrl+V UIE2E is still pending. |
| Comment marker pixel assertion | Automated test | `GridViewDrawingObjectThemeTests.CommentMarkerRenderer_PaintsRedTriangleAtCellTopRight` renders the comment indicator path and samples red-dominant pixels at the top-right marker location. |
| Picture body/handle hit testing | Automated test | `GridViewDrawingObjectThemeTests.PictureHitTesting_MapsPictureBodyAndResizeHandleToObjectCommands` verifies a visible picture maps to `ObjectKind.Picture`, body move hit testing, and the SE resize handle path. Full live drag/resize persistence remains pending. |
| Touchpad wheel delta normalization | Automated tests | `ViewportScrollCalculatorTests.CalculateWheelScroll_UsesNormalizedTouchpadDeltaForSmallVerticalMovement` and `MainWindowWheelHandler_NormalizesRawMouseWheelDeltaBeforeScrolling` verify sub-120 wheel deltas feed the scroll calculator. Live wheel/Shift+wheel/Ctrl+wheel input remains pending. |
| Chart, hyperlink, and font command route guards | Automated tests | `MainWindowSourceHygieneTests.RibbonChartButtons_RouteThroughRenderableChartInsertionCommandPath`, `HyperlinkDialogAndCtrlClick_RouteThroughSetAndNavigatePlans`, `FontDropdownSelection_SyncsThroughStyleDiffToolbarStateAndGridTypeface`, and `MainWindowFontFormattingTests.FontFamilyDropdown_AppliesModelStyleAndGridTypeface` guard the latest source routing plus deterministic font dropdown model/typeface flow. Live mouse/key/dialog/render persistence remains pending. |
| UIE2E input harness expansion | Test harness | `FreeXUiRun` now has foreground-gated `HoldControlAndPress` and `WheelAtCell` helpers plus Win32 `MOUSEEVENTF_WHEEL` support for future Ctrl+V/Ctrl+C, Ctrl+K, wheel, Shift+wheel, and Ctrl+wheel live tests. A direct formula UIE2E rerun timed out in this desktop session, so new foreground-dependent scenarios remain gated instead of added as always-on assertions. |
| Shared UIE2E app instance | Test harness | The live UIE2E suite now has a single `FreeXUiE2eTests.SharedAppInstance_CoversLiveUiScenarios` fact. It starts one `FreeXUiRun`, executes the cell-overflow and formula-editing harnesses against that same FreeX process, then closes the app once at the end. |
| Shared UIE2E launch guard | Automated source guard | `MainWindowSourceHygieneTests.LiveUiE2eAppProcessLaunch_IsCentralizedInSharedHarness` scans the host test sources and fails if another test file starts `FreeX.App.Host.exe` or calls `FreeXUiRun.Start()`. In-process `new MainWindow(...)` layout tests remain model/window construction tests and do not launch the app executable. |
| Shared in-process MainWindow harnesses | Test harness | `MainWindowAdaptiveRibbonTests` and `MainWindowRibbonKeyTipTests` now keep one WPF `MainWindow` alive per harness class, reset workbook/menu/keytip/dropdown/layout state before each assertion, and avoid per-test `Show()`/`Close()` churn. Focused verification passed 47 WPF tests. |
| Real WPF file-drop command route | Automated source guard | `MainWindowSourceHygieneTests.MainWindowFileDrop_WiresWindowDropToWorkbookPlannerAndOpenFile` verifies the window `AllowDrop`/`DragOver`/`Drop` wiring still flows through `WorkbookDropPlanner.SelectOpenableFile` and `OpenFileAsync`. Live `DragDrop.DoDragDrop` evidence remains pending. |

## Blocked / Invalidated Smoke Attempts

| Attempt | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-21 catalog Wave 1 guarded live input | Blocked | FreeX launched, but global keyboard/mouse focus was captured by an unrelated Microsoft Excel window. The generated screenshots were invalid and deleted. Future live input passes must verify foreground process/window title immediately before every global mouse or keyboard action, or use process-scoped UI Automation patterns only. |

## Session Notes

- Subagent coverage inventory found strong planner, parser, formatter, XAML, and command-status tests, but limited end-to-end WPF workflow coverage.
- High-risk manual gaps: keytip placement/routing, real WPF focus transitions, partial shortcut paths, dialog workflows, file picker/print/export flows, pivot UI, and visual fidelity.
- Test harness incident: a later automation pass failed to bring FreeX above OneNote before sending input. Accidental OneNote input was immediately undone, and invalid OneNote screenshots were deleted from `docs/ui-test-artifacts`. Future passes must verify the foreground window title is `Book1 - FreeX` before sending global keyboard input.
- Harness adjustment: subsequent passes use UI Automation invocation plus `PrintWindow` screenshots so FreeX can be tested without stealing foreground focus. This works well for normal buttons/tabs, but popup/dropdown flyouts need a separate foreground-safe mouse-input strategy because they are not reliably captured through the owner window.
- Foreground-safe mouse limitation: Windows foreground locking later kept Codex in front, and the harness correctly aborted before sending mouse input. Further visual click testing should be done only when the foreground guard confirms a FreeX-owned window title, or through a dedicated interactive runner.
- Harness targeting note: a name-only UIA lookup for `Insert` can hit the Home-ribbon Insert button before the top-level Insert tab. Future tab sweeps should filter for `ControlType.TabItem` plus name.
- 2026-05-26 targeted gap pass: subagents re-inspected external paste, WPF drag/drop, picture manipulation, touchpad wheel, chart insertion, hyperlink/Ctrl+click, and font dropdown/render sync on the latest synced branch. Stable automated guards were added for real OS clipboard text, comment-marker pixel rendering, picture object hit testing, high-resolution wheel normalization, chart/hyperlink/font command routing, and deterministic Home font dropdown model/typeface flow. Real WPF drag/drop, chart insertion by actual ribbon click, hyperlink dialog plus Ctrl+click navigation, picture body/resize dragging, and touchpad wheel gestures still need foreground-gated live UIE2E evidence.
- 2026-05-26 continuation: after resyncing from `origin/main`, subagents scoped the next live UIE2E seams. The live harness gained Ctrl-key and wheel helpers with foreground process checks, and file-drop source routing now has a stable guard. The direct `FormulaEditingUiE2eTests` run timed out in this session, so no new live interaction pass is marked Passed from that attempt.
- 2026-05-26 shared-instance update: the separate live UIE2E facts were combined into one `FreeXUiE2eTests` fact so the app launches once, runs all current live UI scenarios in sequence, and closes once. Scenario-specific code remains in reusable harness classes.
- 2026-05-26 launch-surface audit: all test sources were reviewed for process launches. The only checked-in `FreeX.App.Host.exe` launch path is now `FreeXUiRun.Start()` inside the shared UIE2E harness, and a source guard enforces that future UIE2E scenarios append to the shared harness instead of creating their own app process.
- 2026-05-26 in-process MainWindow reuse: the repeated adaptive-ribbon and keytip WPF harnesses were converted from close/recreate-per-test windows to shared windows with per-test state reset. `dotnet test tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests\FreeX.App.Host.Tests.csproj --configuration Debug --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MainWindowAdaptiveRibbonTests|FullyQualifiedName~MainWindowRibbonKeyTipTests|FullyQualifiedName~StatusBarLayoutTests" -m:1 /nodeReuse:false -p:UseSharedCompilation=false -v:minimal` passed 47/47.
- 2026-05-26 dirty-close harness fix: after workbook dirty tracking added a close-time save prompt, WPF `MainWindow` tests that mutate a workbook can hang during teardown. MainWindow-hosted tests now close through `MainWindowTestCleanup.CloseWithoutSavePrompt`, preserving the production prompt while preventing modal save prompts from blocking automated runs.
- 2026-05-26 user feedback batch 3: added automated coverage for legacy Data filter keytips (`Alt+D,F,F`), autofill edge-scroll intent/calculation, Save As backstage return routing, inline formula point-mode/focus guards, and existing `COUNTA` evaluator support. Focused verification passed `GridViewAutofillTests` 4/4, Host source/keytip/viewport tests 154/154, formula/keytip focused Host tests 35/35, and Core formula `COUNTA`/coercion tests 33/33; full solution build passed.
- 2026-05-27 user feedback batch 3 follow-up: added formula range-entry shortcut parity coverage for selection-moving keys while a formula editor is active. `Ctrl+Shift+Arrow` now routes through worksheet data-boundary selection planning and updates the live formula reference range instead of being swallowed by the text editor. Focused verification passed Host formula range/edit-key/source tests 43/43.

## Current High-Risk Gaps

| Gap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Real WPF end-to-end coverage is still thinner than planner/parser coverage. | Unit tests prove command planning, but mouse/focus/menu automation can still fail in the real window. |
| Dropdown galleries and nested menus need systematic mouse/keytip passes. | The XAML contains hundreds of click handlers; grouped menus are where command routing commonly drifts. |
| Target-specific command behavior needs explicit coverage. | A command that works on a single cell can still fail on rows, columns, filtered ranges, tables, pivots, charts, or protected sheets. |
| Modal dialogs need access-key/focus/UIA sweeps. | Many dialog parser tests exist, but keyboard users and UI automation depend on WPF wiring and focus return. |
| Object and contextual surfaces need selection-state coverage. | Chart, PivotTable, table, drawing, slicer/timeline, and sparkline commands are invisible until the correct object is active. |
| Persistence checks should be attached to UI actions. | Formatting, page setup, charts, pivots, tables, and protection need save/load proof, not just visual proof. |
| Foreground-gated live input remains needed for the latest hard UI gaps. | The current pass added deterministic guards, but real OS drag/drop, ribbon chart click, hyperlink Ctrl+click, picture drag/resize, touchpad wheel, and pixel-level font dropdown render proof still need an interactive desktop runner with per-action foreground checks. |

## Next Catalog Tasks

1. Continue expanding the source-based machine-readable inventory guard beyond the current command, shortcut, top-level/contextual tab, dialog, XAML click-handler, UIA automation-id, keytip metadata, worksheet context-menu, screenshot-tool, evidence-artifact, and catalog snapshot counts.
2. Expand the process-scoped UI automation snapshot harness beyond the visible-control, shell-pattern, shortcut/key-routing, and dialog-pattern checks.
3. Attach `tools/screenshot_excel.ps1` and `tools/screenshot_ribbon.ps1` visual evidence to catalog rows, with a foreground-window guard before any global input.
4. Continue Wave 1 and Wave 2 on the latest build, recording every pass/finding in this catalog.
5. Expand each `UI-CAT-*` row into per-command child rows as live testing reaches that area.
6. For each finding, add a focused automated guard when the bugfixing session closes it.
